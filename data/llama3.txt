it keeps crushing ever since the update, can u pls fix this, and don't tell me to restart cause it doesn't help at all	bug report
Overall, this app has been pretty solid. However, I'm giving it two stars because ever since the Lollipop update, it takes normal videos and distorts them sideways. Even if I film in Landscape, it somehow distorts them! Others have been asking for this to be fixed for months, and nothing has been done.	bug report
it doesnt leave me notifications however it's a good app	bug report
I enjoy the signal app very much and in this day and age I appreciate the anninimity	irrelevant information
The app would be great, but it uses an insane amount of data. It is fine if you're mostly on WiFi, but using it on cellular is crazy. You can easily run up 100 MB in a day. I'm not sure what the problem is but I would guess it has a lot to do with it constantly loading different ads and also seemingly reloading any mms messages you've received every time you open the app.	feature request

Unreliable notifications: I use it for work messaging. The ability to mute it is great, especially when others send messages during my sleep hours! However, the notifications are unreliable, which is a huge issue. I have it set to notify me, but it does not (unless I have recently sent a message? Not sure what makes the difference.) That limits the app's usefulness. I don't need to send photos or videos so I don't know about that function.	bug report
Every update takes this service further towards complicated and for average user unusable.	feature request

Best call quality I've ever seen from a chat app, surpassing apps like discord and Viber by a long shot. Where Skype fails to keep up,though, is the chatting part. Chatting is unitive, missing a lot of animations , as well as features like swiping right to exit a chat that would make a perfect choice. It's definitely worth using if you care about a feature-rich , smooth calling experience. That's all I have to say for Skype.	feature request

I use Discord as my main messaging and VC service. It seems that the chat feature is no longer a priority. I regularly do not get notified about new messages. This is not isolated to me/a single device. It happens on my phone and computer, as well as to the people I talk to. I am also regularly confronted with the inability to use emojis, search gifs or edit messages. This does seem to be isolated to mobile. All of this is extremely frustrating as someone who gives Discord money.	bug report

I've loved Disxord since 2019 but the new update has completely ruined the mobile experience for me. Instead of everything you needed being within two taps from each other in the UI, there's now 10 more steps you gotta take just to find out who's active in the server you're in. It would've been way better if the swipe to navigate was still implemented, but unfortunately it is not. It's so incredibly frustrating to use and I will no longer be using Discord on my phone because of this.	feature request

Long time user, since 2017; this new mobile UI update is very poor. The attempt to go modern with the graphical colors being changed isn't very good.

I like this app for some features, but there are major problems with your UI. First of all it's buggy and glitchy. The UI is unoptimized and laggy even on new phones. And recently you added Voice Recording messages for small servers and DMs. I won't even ask who ever need this function when there's a voice chat available, but at least give us an OPTION to REMOVE the ANNOYING VOICE RECORDING BUTTON in settings. I'll stop supporting Discord via Nitro until this fixed.	bug report
Optimize this app please	feature request
This is a good app for everyone	irrelevant information
It was good until they dropped sms support. Now i have to run multiple apps because i cant use just one messaging app for all my contacts anymore. Huge disappointment.	feature request
The new format change is.. Questionable. It doesn't feel like discord anymore, more comparable to Amino or Facebook. It isn't bad, but it's not discord anymore.	feature request
Can't even make a account. Tried on the desktop website and now the app. Tried through all 3 options and none of them were accepted?!?! ü§î idk any ideas üí°	bug report
new update is wack af. lags like crazy why fix sumn that wasnt broke only to break it. boooo	bug report
"used" to be the best texting app. Now the ads have gotten to be 90 percent of the screen. Tour lucky if you can see 3 or 4 lines worth in the texting screen. I have switch apps now due to this	bug report
So I have a problem with the voice recording thing. So everytime I press hold to record something and releases it to finished it, it won't release at all.. Like it continues to record even without pressing the hold thing, I hope you fix this minor problem since I was excited that I can finally use the voice message üòÖ.	bug report
I'm giving it a 2 to a 3for the fact that notification issues as well as well as there is no way to delete chats or messages .and only to my knowledge it just hides them. it's a pretty cool app for group messaging though !	feature request

Too many ads. Was in store with perfect Wi-Fi signal but it said my quality was too low to dial out.	bug report
Basically an amazing app, but the new update is killing my eyes bc, since I have dark mode turned on, each time there's a new message in a specific channel I'm active in, "1 new message since xx:xx" pops up each SECOND. I get it's a useful function, but please return how it was before (when you're scrolled to the bottom of the channel, the message that pops up in which I explained) so people don't gotta have their eyes beaming up and down each time there's a new message. Thanks!	feature request

Was ok until it offered me a free sim card and when I got it, plugged it in and it wouldn't work. Then realized their contact button leads you in a loop, there is no way to contact customer service.	bug report
Mobile discord is absolutely a mess... While I love the pc version of it, on mobile there are plenty of glitches such as back gesture being broken while seeing someone's profile, missing features. I'm one of those who prefers the old ui, way more smoother and reactive (windows has it). Why would it go "idle" when i put discord on background and it doesn't do that on pc?? There are so many inconsistents I just have 500 chars but honestly discord is a really good yet bad optimizated app...	bug report
I don't know why this app is laggy in my device I reinstall this app many times but it doesn't work and mic unmute is so laggy in my device I try this app in laptop and it's not even laggy. so can you please fix lagging issues.	bug report
Only pushes notifications maybe half the time so I have to constantly open it and check. Frustrating for me and the people I message	bug report
Useful but connection for calling is horrible even with me being right next to the hotspot it still says poor connection so that's a flaw! But other than that it's pretty good!	bug report
This works great for my large group of 40+ people. However, its used mainly for announcements, so people don't respond. Please remove the feature where people who are new and don't respond get automatically removed from the chat and it notifies everyone. It creates spam and then people are much more likely to leave, creating more spam because every time anyone leaves or is added it sends unnecessary notifications.	feature request
Giving only 3 stars this time because the latest discord update broke the emote shortcut when I try to use the emote using the colon (:). The keyboard stays in the way with no way to scroll for or see the emotes.	bug report

I am highly upset discord at your new choice of an update. Many people are complaining and want you to go back to the last update there was, and so do I. It's now harder to do everything on discord and it's highly upsetting people to the point they are quitting. It was 5 stars before but now it's just, not discord, it doesn't have that feeling anymore. I put 5 stars because it will be 5 stars if you go back to the last update, I'm sorry discord but this update was just not wonderful at all.	feature request

Horrible service. Calls kept dropping/	bug report
App has gone from being easy to use and intuitive to a UI nightmare due to horrible changes. Private messages has been hidden behind another tab. You are unable to swipe to see a members list, instead it selects a message to reply. Search function is a severe downgrade as are pins. There is no longer a "in channel" filter either. Icon changes are frankly confusing to a user base thats had the same ones for years. The forced "fancy" ui in calls is unneeded and an eye sore. More to say Out of-	feature request
e.g. bus or train wifi catching up with friends. Liking a comment falsely lights up the heart in advance before any request is sent to the server, then *silently turns it back off* after a variable number of screen refreshes or a variable (different) amount of time spent offscreen *or* onscreen. Thanks to this false display the only way to know that anything went through successfully on slow internet is to restart the whole app. Infuriating and frustrating, and fixable with a simple design decision change.	bug report
Outgoing calls do not work. The person I call can hear me but I cannot hear them and it does this every time. Wifi signal is excellent and I have a very fast connection. Incoming calls work but that doesn't matter to me because it is outgoing calls that I need more than anything. Uninstalled and reinstalled and still the same results. Watched a bunch of ads to get minutes all for nothing!	bug report
I have had GroupMe for a few months now and it randomly deleted all of my coversations and group chats today. I uninstalled and reinstalled the application and it still does not work.

This is dogshit.	irrelevant information
They removed the option to change back to the old UI. I had it enabled since the new one is just worse in every way and I accidentally disabled it. After that there was no longer an option to change back to the old one. The new UI is just awful to use, the old one was intuitive and simple. I don't understand why they have to make it deliberately worse. Ill really consider uninstalling it since i find it so inconvenient to use.	feature request

excellent free texting and phone calls with wifi... I also got the sim card to have unlimited calls anywhere . I can make calls, but it seems the connections are not always strong. people have tried to call me when I've been away from my own wifi and some calls go through and some don't. Stull, its worth the $ 4.99 I spent for the card as the service is available more often than not.	bug report
The app is legendary , and the experience is very well , Voice is very good with the Noise Cancellation , but the app have a lots of proplems , like conection proplems , acconts proplems , and most importantly, I can't change email , or logging in to my acconts , because of the "Are you a Robot?" , I hope Discord will fix that and i'll come back and give 5 stars to the application.	bug report

Recording a voice message while playing music in the background is a useful feature when connected to an external audio receiver. Since a recent Signal update, this no longer works and music in the background is paused when the record button is pressed. SMS support was removed, pushing users to different solutions, like Messages by Google which supports SMS and RCS (with E2E encryption). This used to be the best messaging app, seems like that time is gone.	bug report

The new update is awful. Although the previous versions were a bit on the janky side, it had its charm. This new update ruined all of that. I can not swipe right to see who is and is not online. It took me a solid 2 days to realize I had to click on the channel name. Why is everything separated? This update is like being a South American native, living peacefully, and beheading your neighbors. To the discord devs arriving in wooden boats slaughtering the people you know, ruining our livelihoods.	feature request

The recent discord mobile update has removed a lot of functionality that I relied on in the old version: right swipe to view channel details, working server-wide search with proper filtering, ability to view full comments and embeds in pinned list and search results, to start. Switching between direct messages and servers requires additional presses. And there are bugs too. I'm unable to view sever context menu anymore. Direct messages don't scroll to latest message. Use desktop app instead.	bug report

Thing is, the new update that came along, probably today or at least on my end, is the most TERRIBLE, and I mean TERRIBLE, update that Discord has ever released. UI is weird, everything is in a new order, some important features like server sorting and folder making is in awkward spots, and it's gross to maneuver around. I wish for the update to be turned back to the old and iconic look.	feature request

THIS APP HAS SO MANY ADS THAT ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO NAVIGATE ON THE APP. ADS WILL TAKE OVER YOUR SCREEN, ADS HAVE PROBLEM LOADING SO BEING ON THE APP IN MID TEXT WILL CAUSE SCREEN TO BLINK WHITE WHICH REMOVES THE ABILITY TO REPLY. I HAVE GOOD WIFI AND STILL THIS APP HAS ISSUES CONNECTING CALLS AND AUDIO WILL MESS UP IN MID CONVERSATION TO WHERE NO ONE CAN HEAR ME. NEW NOTIFICATIONS SHOW ONLY WHEN THEY WANT TO SHOW.

It is an amazing app to use to text and call, the way it sounds for a call is better then anything else I've used. Although recently I have noticed that I can't see voice messages that a friend sends me. Other then that it is a great app to use.	bug report
The app was good at start but after you send a certain amount of texts, people don't get your texts anymore. The app takes forever to load and floating chat does not even open the texts anymore. The ads are very bad to. Sometimes they will cover up your keyboard and you accidentally click on them and they bring you to a new site. And the terms of use are straight up stupid. Your account gets banned like every other week. I do not recommend AT ALL.	bug report
Every update they manage to bug something, it's crazy	bug report
It's my favorite messaging app, but i dropped a couple stars because I used to be able to use it to manage both signal and SMS messages in a single app, and they dropped SMS support. It's a pain to have to use multiple apps now.	feature request

I enjoy this app while it lasted. Ads can interrupt calls and pop ups can prevent you from answering phone call. Also be aware that they have terrible customer service.	bug report
It does what it's supposed to, I assume. Text groups of people whose numbers you don't have.	irrelevant information
Basically what others have said. The new update is unintuitive and clunky. It was better when it was as 1 to 1 as the pc app as possible. (That doesn't mean you should put this hot garbage on the pc app, please just put mobile back on the old version... I know how you guys are...) I basically never swap servers these days because swapping between the two is annoying. Sure, it's a small thing, but so are flies.	feature request

GroupMe is a good way to chat not just with friends but create a group chat with your college students/partners just in case you dont want to give out your personal information it's like discord. The reason I give GroupMe a 4 star is because it does not give you an option to delete your conversation with someone else but rather gives you the option to hide the conversation that's good too but still where's the option to delete that the only con I give this app for.	feature request

Please Fix This App My Time & Date Are Already Up To Date	bug report
It's an okay app. I use it for my fantasy football league that I manage. The notifications are the most annoying feature about this app. It seems that no matter how many times you tweak the settings, it still buzzes or they don't even come through. Aside from that, I feel like this is missing a ton of features. Especially that there is no feature to pin messages and the top of the chat. If I have something important that needs to be "in your face" I should be able to pin the message at the top. Simple easy fix. I feel like the GroupMe team at Microsoft needs to look at other messaging apps like FB Messenger and WhatsApp and take the best things from it. This app works and I don't plan on leaving but put some effort into it please. Nothing I feel has changed in the past 3-4 years except they added a skype button and the top and some campus connection deal. OK app at best.	feature request
seems to slow my phone down a whole lot...	bug report
Adding people needs to be easier.	feature request
The new update is not good. Looks like you're updating the ui for no reason other than to make it new. Biggest thing for me, swiping left now replies to a message where it used to show who is online. This seems to be a feature for big servers where you don't care to check whose online but for people on servers with only friends, its very clunky. Discord isn't a discussion forum, its an app to connect with friends and play games. If you undid the latest UI update, I'd give five stars.	feature request
Was great before microsoft started breaking things as as they always do. The user interface is now utterly retarded and horrible to use. And now I can no longer use a keyboard to dial.	bug report

It works well, but they send a lot of spam. Also, Ticketmaster will not send verification texts; they say this type of number is unsupported. I'm sure there must be others, as well, that will refuse to send such codes to a VoIP number.	bug report
Its nice and i think better than the other apps because all the other apps i use for messaging it has too many ads or i have to pay for it this app doesn't have that many ads and its very useful if you dont have your phone on (like paid) and your looking for a calling or message app in one app!	feature request
This thing is useful, especially if you find yourself without service for some reason, but it is absolutely saturated with ads that are distracting and annoying. I don't even see a way to pay to opt out of them. That makes it worse. I'm keeping it until the end of my vacation, but I wouldn't use this long term.	feature request
This app is good for keeping up with group activities. My main problems: there is no way to delete old messages, you can only mute and hid them. I want/need them removed permanently. Also when a message is deleted it shows it was delete in the whole group. That is a problem for me as well! There is no way to edit after you post. I also agree with 99% of the other user's problem. This app needs a major over haul! Fix these and I'll give this app 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è	feature request

Horrible. The new Layout is horrible, not only that, it brought a lot of bugs. 1. It takes ages to open chats, switch between servers and often the app even crashes. 2.

Without those it would get 5 stars, but due to the issues ive been encountering due to the new update it only deserves 2.	bug report

Like it for the most part. Just wish I could send a 1 time message to multiple people including ones that aren't on signal without creating a group. Edit Like many others are saying, the removal of sending SMS is not going to work for me. I have many contacts that are not on Signal. This makes Signal the same as WhatsApp in my opinion and will not be using it as my default messaging app any longer. Will bring the 5 stars to 1.	feature request

The one thing I hate about GroupMe is that it takes like 10 minutes every time I try to send a video or post a picture. Sometimes it won't even send or go through. It will just have an exclamation mark in red where the loading sign was. When I click the red icon it will give me the option to delete or retry. It shouldn't take this long to send a post or video! I have great wifi and my internet is working. In addition to this I can't even watch my own videos that I posted :/ Don't understand..	bug report
Uninstalling this as soon as it won't be supporting SMS, the one feature that separated this app from all the rest. Convenience trumps security all the time, you should know this	feature request

The mobile update really ruined the experience for me. I dont care about the UI but the amount of bugs I have run into since the implemented it is astounding. I have to restart my app multiple times for my server list to load in on the right hand side.

I love the app in it's entirety, but as an Android user there has been a problem with the emojis.

My call continuously drops now if my phone screen is locked after a couple of minutes. Not only that, but now everytime I call someone, it shows they are on speaker for me, but in actuality on the phone. And if they leave and rejoin, even if they were on speaker before, it switches them to phone even though it says they're on speaker. Every time I make a call now, or someone rejoins the call, I have to select phone and then go back to speaker for it to work. Super annoying. Also super laggy.	bug report

I pay Skype for a landline number to receive incoming calls. The past 3 days it hasnt been ringing on my mobile (works fine on computer) when people call, it only tells me, through a notification, that I received a missed call.....some time after the person hangs up...not even straight after. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling numerous times without success. Randomly a call may make it through, but youre looking at one out of 12 times. Other than the occasional problem before, Skpe has been great. This really needs to be fixed...and I have not changed my phone or settings.

Discord had a great, if sometimes buggy app, that got the job done great at least 9/10 times. Then they 'updated' it. Now it's a buggy glitchy mess that more likely to go unresponsive and drop calls than it is to work. Layout is unneeded and annoying, now functions make it actively worse to use, and worst of all the devs are actively telling their users that *they* are the wrong ones. They dont care about their community, and if this keeps up, they will kill their app. This made me cancel Nitro.	bug report

So, I wanna try really hard to like the new UI, but it's horrid. The old one was cozy, it was simple and easy to do stuff, I used it for everything. but this new one, it's trash.

calling not totally freew	bug report
This app is HORRIBLE!!!!! You have limited time to talk to people when you call them because you have minutes. And if you want to get more, you either have to download apps and do something on it, or you have to watch ads which only gives you one minute. Also, if you get your phone number on there it doesn't work. If you give people you phone number they can't even text or call you. This app Sucks.	bug report
Mobile is now too much like Facebook in the worst ways. I uploaded photos to a server and it never appeared but the last person I private messaged received ten duplicates instead. Signal now always hangs and I restart or flush to get the best chance of receiving my friends messages an hour late or only on active screen. Before this version, it was very rare to miss anything. I won't continue troubleshooting due to frustrating UI changes that pushed me enough to leave servers and go to Telegram.	bug report

"you'll get used to it" hey just an update‚ÄîSTILL not used to it. the design choices from this update are so nonsensical that they transcend a learning curve. the user experience makes no sense anymore and the only way to "get used to it" is to become comfortable with some of the worst decisions I've ever seen in a commercial app. the mobile version is borderline unusable now.

Away from my laptop for several weeks on holiday, using mobile version: dear lords above this is impossible to use. This UI is literally my least favourite (and I tear my hair out with every insta update, please think of my follicles): broken swipe actions, accessing messages and servers isn't intuitive at all. Restore the original interface. Not listing anymore issues bc I'm not using discord: I literally can't after this update. Waiting (im)patiently for the original version to return.	bug report

I don't know how well this app works. Can't tell you how friendly the user interface is. Can't tell you anything about call quality. Or if it's one of those apps that just wants all your info first and then you find out you have "zero minutes" and can't even use it for the reason you downloaded it. Thats because apparently there are no US phone numbers available in the first 12 area codes I tried. So I'm guessing it's buggy if you try to use it But I hope it works well for you.	bug report

The discord app for Android generally works well.

Newest update is horrible. Stop the terrible choices. Whatever you did now not only cuts my microphone when I go to a different app while on a call with someone, but now it cuts their audio and I can't hear them. Even if I hit the home button while it says im on call with them it will cut my microphone and their audio. Stop with these terrible choice updates. They keep breaking the app. Bring back the ability to speak with people on call while I use other apps on my phone! It's not a wifi issue!	bug report

Barely Functional. This used to be my go-to for a phone and now it's just overrun with ADs. I get you gotta make your money but when they pop up when you're about to push "send" in a msg and you click the AD instead, it's a bit much. You also used to be able to get Verification Codes but now it's behind a paywall. Other than that, its functional. Barely. The ADs are so intrusive that it's just not worth when you can get a real number for $20mo and not have to deal with it < hands down worth imo.	bug report
UPDATE #2: Removing the AMOLED mode was a big mistake, if I could I would give 0 stars. UPDATE: After the newest UX/UI change (it's not an update!) the app is unusable - unintuitive, hard to navigate, just bad. After the latest update the app refuses to stay in RAM. Every time I open it or click a notification and it was left in memory before it still shows the boot screen and for a second a red block button and no chat appear & after that chat comes back. Was great before the update...	bug report

With recent updates it seems that the app has been more glitchy in terms of updating Room names, profile pictures, and even room pictures.

One of the best social networks I've been on for years, and honestly it's the one I use the most today. The only problem I have had during these years and the only reason That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5, It is because in my case I have an error with my xiaomi pad 5 pro tablet, that the error is that every time I want to download multimedia content, it does download it but discord closes automatically. Apart from that small detail, the application is very good.	bug report
Dismayed the app no longer supports SMS also: main reason for using it will be gone. Prev review 5/22/21: Excellent security features, great chat features. Supports unicode characters and keeps emoji fairly updated. Staff listen to reviews and feedback. Make sure you know your pin and backup number if you make and transfer backups! Being in control of my data and privacy is so freeing in an age of data mining and spying apps! Hoping Signal sticks around and keeps improving for decades to come	bug report

You say you can call for free yet, make someone do offers and watch ads for no reason then STEAL THE MINUTES!!!! WHEN SOMEONE HAS ONLY TALKED FOR 2:38 AND YET I HAVE -2 MINUTES!!?? GRIMY!!!

Lowering rating in correspondence with the announcement of removing SMS integration. Non tech people don't like more than 1 or 2 apps for messaging. So you're beat out by regular SMS/Messages by Google and FB Messenger/WhatsApp. For work/international people use WhatsApp so Signal would maybe be a 3rd app used for messaging at best without the SMS integration. Already have family and friends asking what to move to and how to offload the SMS messages. :(	feature request

Great service ruined by buggy app and poor broken 2fa. Been using discord a while but their services have gotten worse. Whether the app is stuck always connecting even on WiFi. Messages not sending and having to be closed and reopened/reinstalled. Currently it won't even connect to let me join in. This coupled with poor 2fa that currently thinks I'm using my phone number on another discord account (I'm not), stopping me from joining new servers. A common issue with still no fix. Terrible.	bug report

Buggy backup makes phone unusable. Backup stops apps running smoothly. There is no way to pause it, stop it or schedule it. Furthermore sending a prerecorded video makes sound unusable and makes videoplay unusable. I think Signal us not meant to be useful.

But now it crashes if I even try to change between chats or servers, I hate not being able to swipe now and instead have to press a button in the top right, its literally muscle memory to swipe. I'm not sure why Discord felt the need to add so many changes that do nothing to benefit the user not just app but PC version as well	bug report
Was a 5 star, but now a 1. No more SMS ability, no more 5 stars. You can't make everyone use an app let alone keep apps running in the background that people rarely end up using without a large crowd base, so Ill be deleting Signal. It was good while it lasted.	bug report

Simple to use with great security. Not being a social media fan or addict, but still wanting to reach good friends, acquaintances, and family it's the app for me. Can send short messages, pictures, documents, and chat.	irrelevant information
To be honest, it is often really laggy and sometimes unusable. The new profile update (username) where you cannot make it whatever you want is really frustrating. Honestly, I wish these updates did not happen. It is completely unnecessary. The only reason I use it is really just for texting, and even that doesn't work sometimes.	feature request

Your ads interfere with the actual texts. You used to be a good service on my desktop, but when I am in a weak wifi range your app is just about useless because of the constant ads that compete for the little bandwidth there is. Unless you have an ad-free version, I will be looking for another application. Sorry to say but your advertising still gets in the way of actual texting. I have found that Telegram works far better.	bug report

I will no longer use this app once standard texting is removed.	feature request
Gone from bad to good to ugly to SUPERBAD. First, MS removed the option to turn Skype off, then they ruined the status options, now notifications are gone completely. Skype constantly switching to invisible, drains battery a lot, and intrudes in your privacy by accessing all your contacts. As soon as my balance is used up... bye-bye annoying ugly monster. Luckily, there are other options nowadays. Update: it seems the blur background option is now turned on by default with no ability to turn off	bug report
The app is limited in its functionality. It would've been convenient if voice messages and longer video durations. Also, the length of written messages could be longer.	feature request

New ui update isn't great, slows down the app a ton and has been really buggy in general, sometimes the screen gets cut in half when closing the keyboard, it's just a mess. Sad a big company like this couldn't do better. Should at least allow us to undo the change like they did during testing. Some things (searching, member list, etc) arent intuitive like they used to be and gets really annoying. There are a couple niche things I like, but overall the update is a 3/5	feature request

Edit down to 1 star, this newest update is garbage. Please roll it back. I can't even find direct messages at all without someone messaging me first and I click the name. The server listing Is a chore to navigate and the layout overview of chat channels is terrible and uncouth. Please roll it back this isn't good. Edit: back to 4 starts. Massive improvements to the previous update. I have a button for direct messages now. Servers are easier to navigate.	feature request
Still having issues...yes, I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it and the app is newly updated; not to memtion cleaning both my cache and app data prior to reinstalling!

While I understand the idea behind it, the decision to remove SMS support means it's pretty much impossible for me to convince anyone to start using signal. Without SMS functionality, signal it's just one of a plethora of closed-ecosystems with secure messaging. I was waiting to stop using signal hoping they will reverse this decision, when I saw they added a "Stories" feature. I don't need social media shoehorned into every app I use. I will not be returning to Signal.	feature request

Everything that needs to be said about Skype of late has been said, and then some. When it works, it works ADEQUATELY.

Discord is Discord, great app for talking to my friends, would be 5 but the new update is literal cancer. Why would you take away the simplicity of swiping?

I downloaded Skype about a year or 2 ago thinking I might need it but now I don't and it is showing no option of uninstalling it completely on my phone.

Easy peasy texting through internet, no cost and no commitment. Havent tried a full subscription yet. However calls can often cut silent or cut off entirely after 30 seconds or a minute, sometimes in 5 seconds of talking with someone. Becomes very problematic sometimes. Add to that, when recieving a call, I have to be delicate with picking it up, or I can accidentally cause it to disappear until I fully unlock my phone to answer it. Plus, minimizing a call becomes very tricky.	bug report

Mobile discord is bad, so many bugs, threads opening different threads, dms not being able to be opened requiring you to restart the app....app was so much more stable when you were using the first UI, every time a UI update is done it fixes nothing and only creates more bugs.

You get a notification of a new message. You tap the notif and it opens the app. Some messages are clearly missing and not being shown. Close and reopen app then the messages are there. This has been happening across multiple updates. Bad app.	bug report
[Edited to reflect improvements] Use the browser or PC app, they're more stable! While it's now usable compared to previous months, it still feels sluggish and painfully broken. Vital UI elements are a gamble, such as the mute + volume for bots being suddenly gone. Using things such as video streams, forums, the search menu, etc. cause frequent crashes. Some causing an endless loop until I open a discord channel from my browser. Experience seems to reflect management hears, but doesn't listen.	bug report

Works more or less ok on pc. On android almost nothing works correctly. Frequently fails to send messages or notifications of ones received, or just doesn't load at all. On top of that, if you are part of any large servers you basically can't read anything older than 10 seconds since even if you scroll up to older messages, the app automatically jumps back to the bottom every time a new one is sent or the phone is locked and reopened (been asking for a fix for this for the last 5 years)	bug report

This app gave me pop ups on my phone!	bug report
Overall a great app, however it's currently impossible to retrieve my old account because my old phone number is registered on that account, and I can only get a code on that number-it isn't able to get calls or texts because the SIM card is gone. If you added a feature so that I could retrieve a login code through Email, that would get 5 stars from me. Hopefully this is added soon, otherwise I'm stuck without that account.	feature request
Why the developers don't go to check Whatsapp and copy everything and after that I will give you 5.	irrelevant information
It's A Good App Only With The New Update I Can't See People's Profile	bug report

Doesn't let you send or call international	bug report
very useful. its able to make calls pretty much anywhere in the world, sometimes calls aren't the best quality but that can be for a number of reasons other than the app itself, it works exactly like you expect it to. only issue I have is a nitpick really. watching ads to get minutes of calling time can be annoying especially if its an emergency but you don't have minutes but its understandable why its there. this is a Luxury to be able to call people without service not a given right	irrelevant information
Price is inaccurate!! It says $7 a month until you try to purchase the upgrade. Once you click the link it says $7 a week. That is expensive for wifi phone service. You can get a sim second line for $5 or $10 a month. Please fix the pricing glitch. If it is $28 a month it should say it upfront! The free version works fine. The adds are not too bad.	bug report

I've been on Discord since 2016 and never had any problems with the UI. But now, since it's been changed to be more mainstream, it doesn't look good, and it's harder to navigate. I would give Discord 5 stars on desktop and web, but they ruined the experience on mobile by making it not cohesive with the other platforms and changing the messaging UI.	feature request
I have used this app for 3 years now and it's a great way to communicate with friends and meet new people. I only have one problem: You can't play an mp3 file in a channel. I communicate with a lot of musicians, and it gets annoying having to use a separate app to play the preview music they send me.	feature request
Last update on Android. Cannot load videos sent via chat, those same videos load fine via old version of skype for windows. Old status is broken, contact list and chat list do not show yellow/green, at the same time old windows version shows those correctly. New status (last seen) is also broken, most of the time it does not show up at all, and I have failed to find a way to force status refresh. Please do test the functionality before releasing a major version or forced upgrade.	bug report

Frustrated with new version of Skype for many reasons.	bug report
The new update has many bugs & glitches compared to previous versions. Loading times are also greatly increased. Visual changes aren't too much of a big deal, since one will adjust to them eventually. However, this update also caused negative effects on the practical aspects of Discord, which is unacceptable.	bug report
let me block clyde pls ON A SERIOUS NOTE the pin limit is TINY and there are auite a few bugs but most of them get fixed. the layout changes a lot which may be uncomfortable to some users and i completely get that. other than that, its a pretty good app	feature request
I really like it. It has worked well for me.	irrelevant information
Often breaks in various ways and the new update made the ui look horribly worse. I preferred when it was gray. What were they thinking with this update??? Bring back the old UI! Extra star for being a good way to connect with friends. Edit: The automatic review is pretty much lying, with every update the glitches get worse and are never removed.	feature request

If I could give it ZERO stars, I would. Because this new update made a once great app into a buggy, laggy, hard-to-use piece of garbage. If it wasn't for the fact that I use discord primarily on my phone I would have ditched it by now. I really hope they go back to the old UI. AT LEAST GIVE US BACK 'THE SWIPE LEFT FOR ACTIVE USERS' FEATURE! ü§¨ü§¨	feature request

Better than the rest, still pretty bad. Made the app worse to peddle nitro, why get rid of the old username system there was nothing wrong, and I hate the new layout. Stop fixing things that aren't broken, and stop making it like all the other messaging apps- we liked this one for as it was	feature request
Cool app and all, I could chat with my friends if they had it. But as you can see, this app isn't that good, you can't join servers without a link on mobile and that's all I have! I want to be able to chat with people but that makes it really hard, it's not even like I can just go onto the Web version cuz it just opens the app, if I tap "desktop site" cuz the app STILL opens meaning I can't join new servers. This is a huge setback for the app and I'd be rate it 5‚òÜ if it weren't for this.	bug report
It's a good app but sometimes have problems hearing them and them hearing me	bug report

Every time I open a DM it opens it to the top of the current scroll and I have to scroll all the way back down to see the most recent messages. There was no reason to update mobile like this and it has almost universally made the user experience worse. Change for changes sake.	bug report

Before you install the app, please check out how many 1 stars are compared to how many 5 stars. There are around (80) 5 stars, and there are thousands and thousands of (1) stars.

Needs an option to search for specific text in past messages. Also needs an option to export/import messages.

Textfree was a good app. Until then I couldn't recieve some messages. I couldn't recieve or send pictures nor could I make or answer phone calls. When I try calling it kept saying that there was trouble with my internet connection but, my connection is perfectly fine. I also have the minutes so I do not know what is wrong. And I would get a notification saying I got a message but then when I click the app, the message disappears, so I am not able to know what was said. Please fix this situation soon.	bug report

EDITED REVIEW: The new updated app is refreshing and works flawlessly on my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. I am very pleased with the latest release. Thank you! _______________________________________ The latest app spams a large green bar on the top of the screen when watching a live stream. There is no way to turn it off that I know of. Please fix this issue as it is rather annoying and takes up valuable screen space.	bug report

If you are looking for a groupchat app, try another. GroupMe lacks a modern look - it looks the same as it has for years and needs am update. It also lacks a lot of the things that make a groupchat cool - customizing pictures, emojis, nicknames, colors. There is nothing special about this one, and often isn't easy to use.	feature request
A right now I'm giving TextNow one star cuz as I noticed today I can't make any phone calls without being on wifi. My phone and my SIM card that's in my phone is very active and it has mobile data. I can receive text messages and text other people. And people can call me. But for me I can't make phone calls myself without out being on wifi. I don't know why that is. It might be a bug that TextNow is having but they need to hurry up and fix it so I can make phone calls myself.	bug report

Having a really hard time receiving group invites from via email and not being able to open them up to approve them.

Our coach is using this for communication. He added me and there was a glitch, so for a bit I was in a group by myself. I was still showing as being in the big group where discussions were happening. He removed me from the big group and added me again. I got the invite, but every time I accept I get the message that I can't be added. Coach was able to add my husband and it worked, but I can't be added. I tried to get support from groupme, but there is no one to contact. Don't use it.	bug report

This app is pathetic. I have a Google voice number, and was added to a group in this app so that I could receive messages by text. However, the texts are usually mangled, and it's not possible to respond to them in an effective way. What's worse, when I tried to register, the app would not accept my phone number at all! An engineer confirmed that they do not allow Google voice numbers to register, so now I will keep getting messages, but can't log in to use the app or change my settings!	bug report
Was really excited to get to use this app but it only rings once and then it's just silent they can't hear me and I can't hear them	bug report
A great app to talk with the homies. Please stop hastily porting the IOS version onto the Android version.	feature request
The removal of sms support is going to kill this app for me. I've invited people to try it, but it doesn't take long before they uninstall it because they don't care for it. I'm now left with two people who use it regularly. I'm afraid I'll be removing the app because it is no longer relevant for me to keep it installed.	feature request
Kinda stupid how you can't send any pictures if you don't have mins the whole point of this is to be used over wifi morless like you should make it so as long as your on wifi you should be able to send pics	feature request

Since the last update the speech is fragmented and lags. This happens every time with message about poor connection. I've had Skype for years and never had this issue. Please fix.	bug report
Messages that I am supposed to receive lag. Updated over WiFi lag. I work in a school and use GroupMe to respond to student crisis. It is critical to receive notifications immediately.

Current update make it worse. Not simple UI, Pins become useless cuz its hard too see/check now.. no one will ever check pin cuz this now.

Like how can you see something you can't (Cuz its hidden) PC Discord being the best cuz it stay with the simple UI. How to keep on Old UI for mobile... :)	feature request
I have never had a problem with discord before. I love it a lot but in the recent update while I'm in a video call with someone, it turns off their camera at some point and says unstable connection.

Messenger seems to be Implanted in my new T-Mobile Phone. I downloaded Signal but Every way I try to eliminate Messenger apps,I get a warning to download Messenger to avoid viruses. Signal is on my list of apps but I keep getting a message that Signal is not secure. Any ideas???	bug report
This was an excellent do-all secure messaging app. Allowed me to have secure conversations with other Signal users but could also handle unsecure messaging from others, and would allow me to use some of Signal's internal labeling and muting features even on non-Signal contacts. I won over a lot of Signal converts over the years with the above sales pitch, and feel a bit betrayed now it's taking a huge step backwards and becoming Just Another 3rd Party Messaging App by removing SMS compatibility.	feature request
You all should add a feature where you can leave a group on your own	feature request
The app is broken and the voice chat is delayed over 1 second at the best of times and over 5 seconds at the worst of times. When you're not getting delays in voice chat, it's either choppy, or the garbage noise cancelling system mutes people's mics when they're trying to talk. Discord is doing nothing to fix the app and refine it with good ideas and new features. The newest update also broke the app even more and made the layout confusing. All you needed to do was fix it and innovate, baffling.	bug report

PLEASE just go back to the old layout. Everyone I've ever talked to all agree the new version is the clunkiest most complicated version of discord ever made.

It seems like every new update is meant to make the app worse. The newest format is simply awful and off putting. If I didn't use discord as a main form of contact I'd uninstall the app. Its extremely inconvenient and laggy. The dark mode looks more navy than black, but the "midnight" is too dark and makes the fonts look too vibrant and harsh. It's unappealing aesthetically, and it is just a major downgrade. I really like discord so this update is extra disappointing.	feature request

The new UI is really bad. I have tried to get used to it, but it's just an unfamiliar. unintuitive design that is not consistant with other platforms. At least give users the option to use the old layout. TLDR; Don't "fix" a UI that was never broken.	feature request
Does not work on device charged any. It a scam	bug report
Every time I want to text it kicks me out.	bug report
Very good app. Easy to sign up for. Extremely user-friendly.	irrelevant information

Every thing works fine	irrelevant information
Can anyone tell me why ppl arent getting my txts but can txt me? Great app idea but wants it to work. :(	bug report
The new layout is pretty bad. Chats are too small and notifications for unmuted chats are still inconsistent and disappearing. They'll never address the real issues with the app. If my friends weren't already on here I would've deleted this app years ago.	bug report
It keeps changing my phone number!!! SMH	bug report
The new UI is a downgrade in terms of quality. It's bloated, slow and unintuitive. The mobile app updates have been a consistent step in the wrong direction for a while.	feature request
Pretty good mobile version of the desktop app, no crashes or bugs that I have seen. Only gripe is that audio quality is dependent on the phone used and phones just sound worse than mic on a headset or dedicated microphone.	irrelevant information
App is great for FB style, small group communication. I'm disappointed, that there doesn't seem to be a way to delete old msgs. All of the private & public msgs, seem to stay forever. You can hide them from your view. But I haven't found a way to delete them and regain phone space.	feature request
Please stop doing those UI upgrades, you're actually just making things worse. It's not even a matter of people being used to one design, new UIs tend to be more clunky and require more maneuevers to get around with. They're also less intuitive. This poor "update" trend has been going on for a while while in reality UI changes rarely ever make things better.	feature request
Takes a day or more to receive messages and pics.	bug report
A great app, but it's definitely missing some features that PC has. One example is the ability to preview mp3 files, on mobile you have to download it before you play it. Which is sketchy üôÑ	feature request

It should not be necessary to have the app on a smartphone in order to run it on a Windows PC. That is just asinine! Not everybody in the world is using smartphones yet	feature request
Becuase like the app it only lets you call and text people if you hace wifi	feature request
The new layout for the app is atrocious. It may just qualify as a war crime. Please put it back. I'm actually begging you. The swipe to reply is annoying, and the organization feels forced. It feels like you are trying to copy other platforms, but it did not turn out well. I loved the app prior to this update.	feature request
Does voice calls and video calls are end to end encrypted too in signal? If yes then you should mention that in the app like WhatsApp.... Other than that.. everything is perfect.. Btw answer the above question..	feature request
Only issue can't answer incoming calls	bug report
Each DAMN time anyone sends me a message, my phone turns off its screen automatically as if it got possessed. I turned on the screen and it turns itself off again. No problem with other apps, but whenever I receive a signal message, it's f**king possessed. Hope the update can cure this.	bug report
It stops sending messages to people who don't reply to the initial message (if they don't have the app), which sucks because you want everyone in that group to still be able to communicate even if they don't want to reply to the initial text.	feature request
Can't use it in other apps	bug report
It kind of complicated	irrelevant information
Trying to buy Skype credit for phone calls using a new card was very unintuitive.	feature request

There is no option for mute all. there is no option to view participant video like zoom app. these two features required very much to have very good and smooth online meeting.	feature request
For weeks now I've been unable to send voice messages after recording it disappears. I updated and reset all settings still unable to send voice messages after recording. So annoying and disturbing.	bug report
Bring back the old update please .I cant see who's online anymore and i hate the notification sound and it looks like Snapchat. I really enjoyed using Skype before the update mabey you could add the feature to go back like you did for the computer version??	feature request

Although it's easy to use and you only have to invite people one time to call them for free, it lacks luster. Skype acts like video calling is new technology. All I want is to video call with filters and fun features as I was able to do with Google duo before it became the mess of Google meet	feature request
New UI update made it so that the search function in DMs, which I use fairly often, now automatically searches for media instead of text. When you tap over to the text tab, it only finds messages from the other person, not any messages I sent with the searched text in them.	feature request
It worked mostly for a while but one day when I opened it my number was gone and I lost all the numbers I had and everything I try to fix it doesn't work it only has two screens it shows me and those are the finding you number things but I can't type in my old number pls help me out	bug report

Good easy to use the skype	irrelevant information
The new mobile layout is a glitchy, inaccessible, and visually unappealing mess. The app is worse in just about every way- did you like keeping your friend's stream open in a cute little window while you went to check another tab? Sucks, because that feature is gone now. Open a channel and it'll display the contents of a different one with no fix besides closing and reopening. The search feature is useless even when it isn't glitching. This update is a slap in the face to long-time users.	bug report
No nonsense and worki.ng as expected	irrelevant information
It's unusably slow since the most recent update. Can't send messages anymore, lags out, crashes. It's without a doubt the worst update I've ever seen. There's no option to revert the change. Not hotfixes or info from the devs released. Address the problems in your development. Stop forcing unrevertable updates.	bug report
Rating would be a 5...if it actually refreshed/notified me of messages!! Plus the keyboard doesn't want to stay open...this is very frustrating! Please fix!!!	bug report

Was really good. I was able to make calls to the US for free on my 4G LTE+ network. Now it will only connect while on wifi. I had this problem a couple of weeks ago and reinstalled app and it worked. This time after seversl attempts nothing is working. At least I can still text. Was a 5* app. Please fix.	bug report
Its sometimes glitchy but it's ok	bug report
Pretty good but I find it weird that you can't change the theme.  It's too bright at 3am	feature request
I think there needs to be a setting that allows the user to turn off notifications for every text, but periodically let's them know there's been activity.	feature request
Freezes constantly, to the point it is literally unusable. Very disappointing. I hope this is addressed in an update soon.	bug report
this new update ruins discord it was unessisary and unwanted nobody likes this garbage	feature request
The app would just suddenly stop working I'd have to uninstall and reinstall it before I can be able to use it for another short period of time	bug report

This app is great. I can text people very effently. But calling is not. First off you need minutes to call which in my opion sucks. Second all my friend get echo when they call me and fhey hate. They told me that it only happens on this app. So if you are texting (which is what Ido) this app is great for you. If you mostly call do not get this app. I rate it 4 stars because I do not get too many ads from it and I am more use to texting than calling.	feature request
They have removed SMS support	feature request
Groupme refuses to send me notifications when I get messages, and to see if I have anything, I have to go into the app and manually refresh to check for messages. As my primary texting app, this is unbelievably frustrating, and this needs to be fixed.	bug report
Overall good but has way too many ads and the I did experience some issues when trying to make a call	bug report
Doesn't work on the new Google pixel 8 pro :/	bug report
Textnow has always been good for me no problems at all and I'm glad to have found this app also I would highl recommend this app because you get it all for free to call us text whatever you need gives you choices of phone numbers that you get to choose	irrelevant information
Been happening more and more lately where the app will just crash, then tell me it has a bug and needs to be updated. Updated and still won't load any other channels or chats than the one it crashed on	bug report
the new ui is awful. gotta love how instead of listening to their community about unnecessarily changing things they just double down and insist that you either get used to the update or delete your account altogether. also gotta love how they're trying to make the ratings for this app go back up by faking 5 star reviews.	feature request
This app is great, BUT the latest change was absolutely horrendous. Among the reorganizing of things in a way that isn't fun to browse, it's a bug-ridden mess that drives me mad. I tried to send a meme to one channel and it instead sent it to my latest DM! Horrible experience. I'll update this if they ever revert.	bug report
Keeps the team connected	irrelevant information
So many bugs and problems. Many times it won't let me send videos, it would ask me to retry sending videos but it would never work. Notifications are not stable. Sometimes you get notified sometimes you don't. Only using this app because people in the US uses this	bug report
Very good communication app! The only thing is it says 17+ when in my opinion it should be 13+ but very good app and am happy with it	feature request
The phone version is very lag	bug report
Its a great tool and i highly recommend people start using it rather than using other messaging platform. However the users are really less i think more people should adopt the signal seeing the privacy it offers	feature request
Overall it works better than group text features on most phones that limit how many people can be in a group. I'm really getting annoyed with the difficulty to upload pictures/videos and messages. Frequent time outs/failures etc. Not getting notifications about new messages even though the setting is to receive them.	bug report

I can't see anything in my app. Everything comes straight to my phone. Help please.....	bug report
I like it more than other apps because it allows me to stay in touch with friends and family in a more private setting. I really dont enjoys social media apps so this is great. Also phone and video calls have usually good sound and video quality.	irrelevant information

Over 3 years w Signal. I routinely miss notices for hours until I check the app, and it generates errors when attempting the July 5th update.	bug report

This app will not push through notifications unless I have it open and running. Drains the battery and makes my phone very hot to the point it shuts down. But it has no issues playing the ads. I paid for a number however my service is still garbage. My internet connection is great so the issue is with the app itself. So I paid for a number only to have it not work unless I open the app and to be told to pay for a premium service. This is not a good free app nor 8s it a good paid one.	bug report

good app! just took almost a hour to download	irrelevant information
Discord is a decent messaging and communication service, but it is incredibly sluggish, laggy and buggy. It lacks support for audio files on mobile, and it lacks support for mkv and webm video. The mobile app has terrible performance with constant fps drops. If you want a communication service, this is ok but reconsider.	bug report
I would have given this app five stars because I've used this app for a long time multiple times the only reason why I won't give it five stars it's because the other end of my calls complain of an echo during phone calls, I can't complain about the price of the minutes, and I can't complain about how the app goes about it's operation, it's a great app for people to have a second number for business or privacy.	bug report
It will become worthless when they shut down sms support. I'm not going to use two different apps. Such a poor decision.	feature request

No it wasn't, I regret updating.

I was using Text Free as a paying customer and was pleased, but it suddenly stopped working, calls and texts, inbound and outbound. No support! I emailed them with no response back, not even an auto-reply! So, suddenly, everyone I know that I had given the number to can't reach me, and the number is useless. I just emailed them again. If this review is still here, they didn't help me at all.	bug report

App is awful on mobile, changed the AI and made it so much worse, a lot of times the bottom of the screen goes into the buttons at the bottom of the phone, so you have to close the app and reopen it to select your messages, so bad	bug report
they make too many useless and unnecessary changes, like changing the color of the mute button for example ( it confused the hell out of me, won't go into it ), but, other than that, it's fine. make servers for communities ( don't be weird ) or just straight up use it as a texting app.	feature request

UPDATE: This is still happening.*** Signal is now deliberately delaying messages/notifications sent by people who didn't "donate", which I'm pretty sure qualifies as extortion. It has gone so far downhill in the last few months that I cannot in good conscience recommend ever downloading it, unless you'd also like to get your messages 3 to 24 hours late.	bug report

Far from free. Packed with overwhelming ads, even on the paid version there are still TONS of ads. Not sure what is being paid for since the free service gives you the same as paid, ads and all.

Revert back to the old view, where each person's circle is it's own solid color, and THEIR TEXT, NOT MINE, is highlighted in that color. We should at least have the option to configure this ourselves if you insist on forcing a design overhaul on everyone. Now you're configuring the app such that I cannot communicate via signal with people who don't have signal? Three goes the one of the main advantages of this app. Great move!	feature request
Using voice on the app is slightly non-intuitive. Also when receiving calls it doesn't make a sound, so they are easy to miss. Otherwise it's not a bad app.	bug report

Got a new phone and tried to setup... asked for the original pin setup and got some msg about cannot contact service. And proceeded to LOCK me out!!!

When renewing through the Play Store, you have to "confirm through the app". But any time I open the app, it wants to charge me a second time for the same subscription. I have tried making calls, which works, but I keep getting emails asking me to confirm or I will be refunded. The link to open the app doesn't do anything. You guys should sort that out. For now, I will need to wait 3 days for my refund and then resubscribe through the app itself for this to work properly.	bug report

Trying to restore my wife's Signal backup after her phone died and she had to buy a new one, but it always crashes after the backup completes and there's no way to finish the process.

I sent an email to the developers over a week ago, but no one has responded. I've been a huge Signal fan for years, but can't believe the lack of a response.	bug report

I had used signal years ago and now I wanted to check back, and glad to see it is doing great. The design is modern and simple, it has features that it's competitors also have.

The core of Signal is great: secure and easy. Unfortunately, Signal's recent decision to eliminate SMS and MMS support means that it can no longer be used as one's primary messaging app. I used to recommend it to non-techy people as an easy way to improve their security. It's a lot harder to recommend and use now.	feature request

This was a great app before the last update. There's clearly a bug with Bluetooth. Anytime a regular call comes in while you are on a Skype call (even if you do not answer the other call) , Bluetooth will disconnect and it's nearly impossible to reconnect again unless you end both calls. To make things worse the option for speakerphone becomes unavailable as well. It makes for a very awkward situation during Skype calls.	bug report

Great UI and messaging experience, but it has one really staggering flaw: very poor ability to restore message history. When getting a new phone, you can restore history from a backup if you made one -- but only if your new phone has the same operating system (Android or iOS) as the old one. Other devices can be linked to your primary device, but can't access message history, and get disconnected if you change devices. it's just arduous and annoying when I'd rather I could just log in anywhere.	feature request

Review edited because I was knee-jerky at first but my overall sentiment remains: Discord is yet another app suffering from unnecessary updates that degrade the user experience and make it worse. They're slowly stripping away the parity it had with the desktop app (one of its best features imo) to instead messily integrate a bunch of design choices from other apps to create an unwieldy chimera which isn't particularly intuitive to use at all. Very poor showing.	feature request

I get phone calls all the time from telemarketers and I would prefer not to have to deal with them. my notifications being turned off means they should be off	bug report

Discord is great, but I made a new account and its "updated" I guess but it keeps getting stuck in a server and I can't use direct messages. It completely freezes in the server the only other option I have is to make a new one. And me pressing the notification for the direct message doesn't work either. All in all discord is a great app tho.	bug report
Hi, Just need to report bug I am not able to decline or accept the call	bug report

Recently showing too many glitches. Not working properly. It doesn't change the screen when I touched the icons. It always stay in a single screen only	bug report
When you are on the phone for long periods of time, it will cut out and the app shuts down and you lose the call. And during the call if you uave exellent wifi or not the signal is still bad, you can't here the other person aloy of the time. Besides that its a decent app.	bug report
Worked great then they fixed it lmao Why did y'all make it worse??	bug report
No tech support. Although I have credit in the account, can't make a call.	bug report
Very useful app generally and the PC version is great, but every update it seems like the mobile version becomes more and more broken. I've had nonstop issues causing me to be unable to see new messages except from notifications, issues where going to any other channel just shows the messages from where I was before, issues where the bottom half of the channels menu is cut off, and issues where clicking on things like users or reactions creates a popup too small to interact with. Just a mess...	bug report
This app don't work	bug report
The only way to get further in this game more quickly is to constantly spend money. Also, I keep getting malicious content detected and blocked on my mobile phone every time I open the app. It's a decent game, but there are very few useful rewards when playing. You have to pay to unlock cds that you earn from playing the mini games, which is, in my opinion, not a good way to keep people playing long-term. Cds are an important part of getting items in the game. Considering upgrades take days	bug report
Stop updating to change features that everyone likes. The whole point of even using discord is the ui that's actually friendly to users and chats being very customizable. Nobody wants you to keep getting rid of features.	feature request
When I send a message it won't show up then I have to exit out of it the open it back up to see if the message sent it stupid please fix it before I delete the app	bug report

I just signed up for this app and already I'm frustrated with it. I forgot my password so I have tried every way to get a reset link. I have yet to receive one. And yes I have checked the spam folder. It's not in there either. I would love to use this app but it doesn't look like that is ever going to happen.

I've tried and tried just because it's what everyone in my classes uses...but it just doesn't work for me. I HATE this app with a passion.

Do not download this app!!! Immediately after setting up this app I started receiving scam phone calls and text messaging about health insurance quotes. About every 2 to 5 minutes apart. I am going to have to change my number if it does not stop. I used a google voice number to set it up and somehow it managed to get my real number from google voice. Never had this problem with other apps so it is not a coincidence.	bug report
No problems seems to work very well .easy usable.	irrelevant information
Discord is good, update is trash. Like you guys put it in catagorys and it makes stuff harder to find. Like why not bring back the slide and tap. You now made it like you gotta search for everything like folders. 5 stars if it went back to the old way.	feature request

Apparently they removed unencrypted SMS support? What the hell? I'm just... not going to use this app as much if I have to switch between this and another app. Has some technological quirks- notifications not showing up, dates of texts not being assigned right so they don't show at the bottom of the conversation, and some random images just will not send. Very disappointed with the lack of SMS support.	bug report
This is a very bad app, I tried signing up for number, it isn't working, I allow it access my location still, it still saying registration error	bug report
I have used this app for seceral years. It is a wonderful app. Text and calling is free with Wifi the only thing they have changed is now we have to pay for a confirmation codes like from Facebook. Or google or things like that. But it all use to be free.	irrelevant information
I cancelled my subscription. It is still trying to take money from my card.	bug report
Unreliable in the extreme. I've been using the skyoe number for seven years and in the past year its become impossible to make phone calls. The calls connect, you get dead silence until one party gives up. You are charged for these dead calls. Do not use for international phone calls.	bug report

Texting and sending pics thru this app is satisfactory.

While I appreciate that discord updates there at there's been a litany of issues that can certainly cause privacy concerns. The first issue I ran into was that messages that I typed into my notification shade on my pixel 7 or just disappearing. My current issue is that it is common for discord the lock into a DM for one person and I can't switch out to another to send a message. The bigger issue is that messages are starting to send the people that I'm not sending them to. Unfortunate.	bug report
I tried to give the mobile UI a fighting chance, but I'm slowly getting to my witts end with it. It used to be easy enough to swipe and see my servers AND messages on the left, but now it's added an extra step to jump to all messages, and has made it more clunky to find older messages, that I maybe haven't responded to. I know a lot of some issues are muscle memory, but this new update has only added unnecessary steps to an already easy and user friendly design. Pls give us the option to choose.	feature request
Skype is a really good app i use it all the time! I have come across a few problems like if im playing an online game it will sometimes bring me back to the skype screen other than that really good	bug report

Well now I can't even share pics/memes/gifs/emotes and the new layout is more difficult to deal with than the original one that allowed one to simply swipe to the different parts of the app. Still better than Twitter (marginally), but it keeps going downhill with each update as they supposedly "improve" it.	feature request

I really want to give it no stars, but i dont have that option... Im not sure if this app is for kids.. I never heard of it.. with that being said, I check my child's phone.. I looked in this app.. someone sent them inappropriate pictures and asked about giving them allowance. I tried to report them.. but the support people told me that the only thing I SHOULD do is block them.

Since the update its slower and looks different	bug report
I used to use discord all the time but the minute they added the new update, it slowed down my phone and it takes like a minute just to open up a server or a dm even if I have perfect WiFi. It's also super compact and feels claustrophobic, the new controls are confusing and overall as someone who frequently uses desktop as well, it's very difficult to have to switch between thinking desktop mode and phone mode because the new update is really confusing.	bug report
Pretty slow and unresponsive but gets the job done.	irrelevant information
It's good but every time I write a command in my discord it's invisble I can't see what the command is or anything can you fix it or is something I turned off in my settings?	bug report

I've been using this app for the past 7 years and it's the only messenger I've really used in that time. I've loved it for what I've used it for and it hurts to leave a negative review, but the company behind it has been continually rolling out updates the community at large is against. The worst, for me, is that they tout accessibility, yet refuse to listen to their users when their compulsory, major UI updates lead to text being unreadable, to migraines, or, potentially, even to seizures.	feature request

1* to 1*. I was told to reinstall the app... this has made everything so much worse. If I click on an image it cuts off half the screen and doesn't show me the images. Good luck accessing dms.

Customer service is non existent, sent debug data, emailed and still no response. Since the update everything is delayed like my account has been cloned, this is evidenced by way of a technical glitch in the matrix showing 2 x signal options when sharing links or files from other applications. Also the option to drop down a couple of lines when typing has been replaced with straight 'Send' phone stopped ringing, get missed call notification instead.	bug report

Was going great until it stopped accepting my lock code, that I had just made and was trying out. Now I'm locked out of it and I've had this account for all of 5 minutes.

You have a choice between three themes, none of which look good, it has this odd rounded corner esthetic on everything which makes it look ugly and less of the modern feel they were going for, the user list in every server is hidden behind the part the channel name which doesn't look like a button and along with the user list is everything unrelated to it. I do like the new notification tab, but it also takes the place of a home tab showing who is online.	feature request

Discord has been great up until the recent update that changes the user interface, layouts and themes on mobile. Now if I try and open a chat, I get shot back to messages from weeks ago and have to scroll back to the present. Messages aren't reading when they are open and notifications are getting sent late if at all even when I have all my notifications turned on. Wish there was a way to get the old lay out back and not have to use the bar at the bottom to get to servers.	bug report

Adding people has always been buggy (it would say the person could not be added but they actually had been). But for the last week, it has stopped letting me add people at all (in a group I manage).

PURE TRASH! My phone number works just fine but I keep being told it is an invalid or a non-working number! How do Ibverify my text-free number when their bloody system keeps telling me my phone number is invalid or doesn't work?! This earns their system & app 0 stars but since I cannot rate it lower than 1 star I will give it that! MAYBE if they fix their crAPP system so it will accept my phone number so I can validate my text free number I can try it out & POSSIBLY rate it higher! GARBAGE!!	bug report

U don't know when someone is calling you or texting you even though notifications are set to on, it doesn't even come up on the screen or the lock screen, so I would have to continusaly check the app multiple times a day, and that's why I changed apps	bug report
Was working fine until today. Won't send messages and says my number is now inactive and forces me to choose a new one, but when I tried that it still gave me the same error message so I'm in limbo with this issue. Fyi I was just using the app yesterday with no problem, so surely this is some sort of glitch. Now I have no idea if the people I've texted off of the app will be able to send replies to me.	bug report

Best app for what it does	irrelevant information
As a user of discord since 2016, the mobile ui update is a mess of accessibility, visual appeal, and quality of use. Changing every button results in misclicks frequently. It's harder to get from place to place when it used to be quite easy. The dark theme has always been a nice shade, while the midnight theme hurt mine, and many others eyes. The current dark theme steering more towards the midnight theme causes issues for accessibility for those who can't look at the color palette for long.	feature request
Great app. Like the look and feel. Also the gallery, event calendar and polling. Only negative is lack of ability to send voice recordings.	feature request

The newest update is ridiculous on mobile. It doesn't look anything like discord and is extremely annoying to navigate. If there was an option to change to the old display, it would've been done in a heartbeat. I find discord breaks a lot more and the lag is way worse than previously. I can't even open any pins in any channels because discord crashes. The new update was not worth the trouble they went through to make it. I do personally hope they berid of this layout and go back to the original.	feature request
It's very bad I don't know why it's not signing in anymore	bug report
I would give 5 stars but I feel like its not worth al 5 because it drops CALLS WAY TO MUCH... an I feel like it makes u change numbers way to much as well it should wait at least 3 months before it gives your number to someone else. Will update if it gets better this time. But I really don't see it getting any better..	bug report
The current UI system has pretty bad performance. My app updates are manual so I was running the old one for quite some time. Didn't anticipate just how slow and laggy it would be after updating.	bug report
Not reliable. It drops calls all the time, tells you that you have no wifi when you have great wifi, you hear echos on some phone conversations, if you get pissed off at the app during a phone call it drops your call. This app needs ALOT of work.	bug report

I've been using this for almost a year.It's a really great app. One issue is when I try to make calls it tells me that the number that I'm trying to dial is invalid. Also, I've done some of the surveys and whatnot for the free minutes and they never add the minutes! It's really frustrating after going through the whole process and not getting them. It's just a waste of time! If they could get these two issues fixed I would definitely rate it five stars but at this time the best I can give it is three stars.	bug report
I love this app and use it daily but for the past several months I haven't been able to use voice to text. It works everywhere else but Discord. When I press the voice-to-text button, the little microphone appears at the bottom for a split second then disappears. It's very frustrating.	bug report

It doesn't support using numbers for account verification without paying to unlock it.

Redoing my past review: The new layout is absolutly horrible. Why did you remove the old colour scheme, the new one is pain for the eyes the contrast is just bad, BAD. Additionally why did you make that UI so unecessarily complex. It was perfect before, revert this update. It's not too late yet. LISTEN FOR ONCE PLEASE. NOBODY ASKED FOR IT. Or atleast give us an old UI option! I am close to installing an old APK or going mobile webbrowser discord. It's the worst time I ever had with your app.	feature request

Revised review because Discord popped up a "Enjoying Discord? Please leave a review" message. Nothing has changed, the UI update is still hot garbage, and the app is still a lot less stable than it used to be. Original review follows: The latest update completely shook up the UI and layout, broke search, slowed down DMs massively, introduced a ton of input related issues, and just generally made it a worse experience. They need to roll this back QUICK.	bug report
FRAUD ALERT! I have been trying to cancel my subscription, however, the app will NOT show up under subscription on my Play account in app or browser and the App does not allow you to cancel in App. I have reached out multiple times and for 5 months they have continued to charge me. The app was horrible for call quality and I instantly started receiving several dozen spam calls a week on top of this PAYMENT SCAMMING! Absolutely ridiculous behavior and unacceptable.	bug report

The new update is horrible. I can't see who messaged me, it takes several seconds for the app to even load, getting to voice chat text channels is worse and it's just a stupid update overall.

The desktop version is much better, and (IIRC) has a few features mobile doesn't.

When it works it's great, but it usually doesn't. I won't talk about the desktop app which is equally as buggy. Me and my friends physically cannot send images on mobile - ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling. other apps still work fine for image sending if you only want to use this for messaging it mostly works, but if you ever want to use it for images or video sending, unless you have a link to the image, it's a 50/50 shot on whether or not the apps willing to function this time	bug report
This app was great when I downloaded it a year ago. I recommended it to all my friends! But lately it's not receiving calls or even dialing calls.. just texting.

Dials in silence. Does not even ring when I call from another phone number. Please look into these complaints textnow. The app used to be great!	bug report
would be nice if calling was also free	feature request

Love the app!! Don't really like the new voice message It's still a really good app!	feature request
Edit; this app isn't working anymore. I'm not getting notifications and images/gifs won't load. I was hoping it was a connection issue, but after speaking to others I know I'm not alone. Please make this a usable app again.	bug report
I loved this app! Sucks that they are getting rid of the SMS portion. I like having all my texts in one place whether they were secure or not. I will be uninstalling. Hopefully it comes back.	feature request
It is a good app! I love calling and texting on this app! It has loads of great feature like making a poll and more! But I have some negative reviews. When I call my friend and I share my screen me and my friend get really laggy and we both cut out! Also sometimes we both are on hold for no reason and then we hang up again! And the texting glitches alot and it is really annoying! I do love this app but Skype? Can you PLEASEEE fix these bugs? It would mean alot! Bye!	bug report
Used to work great, with the new updates the messages keep showing previous chats, profiles won't load, or sometimes channels disappear entirely.	bug report
I take my online classes for more than 8myears and the experience was superb!	irrelevant information
This is the worst app I've ever used. Drops calls always echoes hardly ever works correctly and you have to earn or buy minutes.	bug report
Great app, but I did found 2 issues: 1. Doesn't receive texts from so called short code numbers, like bank text messaging system or store order update etc 2. If I am a group chat originator, the group gets scrambled texts.  Although it doesn't happen when I participate in group chat originated by someone else	bug report
I would give a 5, except there's no way to delete conversations. Only hide them. other than that, it works great for communicating with my sports teams that I coach, or with a group a friends.	feature request

This app does not work! I have been on an endless email chain with their very sketchy support team and gotten nowhere fast in trying to reaccess my account. I have used this app for years, but now I can't because of my new device (OnePlus 7 Pro). I am required to use this for work, and it simply does not work. I can't send messages. Loading takes forever. I've uninstalled and reinstalled thousands of times. I can't login as it won't send a PIN to my phone number. Microsoft needs to fix this app.	bug report
Full of bugs, not optimised for Android disconnects from VC or audio bugs out and we have to reconnect everytime to fix it, this issue is now for quite awhile like 4 years so...	bug report
The app worked great untill about a few days ago where it said my number was replaced and then it said there were no available numbers at the. I tried repeating the process to re-sign up but it just kept saying error. Otherwise app worked great.	bug report
great little app	irrelevant information
Been using this app since 1 and half years and The experience was also great , i am blessed to find this app. But , i have been facing some bugs lately 1. the problem with appearance - i think , that this problem is only happening with miui 12 users , When i turn on light mode , the display turns more darker which is alright but when i use the spoiler command and tap the texts , it doesn't show the text and , the text is slightly visible but it's hard to identify it.hope you'll fix this issueüóø.	bug report

No problems yet, another very good messenger that's effective for work. The fact that they have minimal to no ads is a huge plus when trying to navigate through the app	irrelevant information
When I first downloaded this app everything worked perfectly. Fast forward to the current times where I don't get any notifications for any messages, I have to open and close the app 2-3 times before it will even work and messages only come through half of the time. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app thinking that would help but no. I have reached out to customer service only to get an automated message stating that they are really back up and can't help right now.	bug report

Dumb app won't let me do nothing waist of time and money even tho it's free and there are so many ads it's forcing me to try to download something every 30 seconds what if people do not want to pay so it's a complete scam sometimes that's all I have to say I mean you have to buy the premium so that you won't have added it just pay but they're already making money after showing so many ads it's annoying stop with the ads I'm not paying for it and I'm never going to pay for this app so stop adds	bug report

I once loved skype. Skype recently introduced a slew of new features, that I personally could not care less about if I tried my very hardest. I want video calling, and that's it. Video quality was never great, but at least it semi functioned. Sure most of my incoming video looked like 90s Mario, but at least i could hold together my long distance relationship with princess peach. Now calls won't process and I've moved on to other apps	bug report
On Galaxy S5, im not getting any notifications for any of my groups. On prior phones however worked fine... if fixed, ill update my score	bug report
My Discord mobile experience has always been iffy: lagging at random times, difficulty with sharing pictures, overall not having a smooth time. This recent update has made me leave this review. I like the new settings menu, but there's too much unused space and no way to compact it. I wish the swipe to reply was optional. The search function is even harder to navigate. And everything else feels like change for tge sake of change. This update is confusing, and pre-existing issues still exist.	feature request

Ads everywhere, even in your message inbox just to much	bug report
Text crashes constantly. Calls even with an excellent signal are sketchy and unreliable. it's basically an ad machine with a barely functioning app attached to it. Nobody in their right mind would pay for this app. Especially considering they are selling all your information. I have uninstalled and reinstalled twice. The problem is not with the users it's a system problem caused by flash ad overload. Gotta get people to like a functional app before you Zuckerberg them.	bug report
Would be great if you can delete conversations instead of hiding them. They come back each time u get a new device. Also need the ability to remove pics from shared gallery.	feature request

It's a wonderful communicating app, almost all my online friends have it, it's becoming easier to talk to my long distance friends!

This app used to work well for me, but now for some reason I cannot see my incoming calls. The phone rings but doesn't show me a notification/screen to even answer the call. It only shows "Missed Call"/‚ÄùVoicemail", after it's stopped ringing. I've updated the app, uninstalled and reinstalled about 4-5 times and I'm still experiencing this issue. Please fix and I'd give a better rating because I do like this app and I don't want to have to uninstall it and find another one. Thanks in advance.	bug report

Every time your message gets deleted by someone else, discord crashes.

The app won't even send my voice messages if I am on my data, even with full service it won't even try and will repeatedly give me an error message even after deleted, I still get the notifications days later. The app itself is fine, I guess, but it's cool features only work like 60% of the time. I wish it was better.	bug report

the recent update is unnecessarily difficult to navigate. the UI is confusing, it's now harder to see who's online in a server, for some reason the pinned messages have been hidden, the app is too laggy most of the time to even use, and my phone now heats up so quickly after opening the app that it feels like it's one degree away from becoming molten lava. the app was fine the way it was, why are you actively making it worse?	bug report

everything is alright and all but there are a lot of bugs that happen on mobile 1. icons wont appear, the thing is when i open my discord icons wont appear like the channel #'s, discord logo, "joining public servers" icon and the making servers icon. 2. the images glitch, the images sometimes go farther on my screen which makes it bigger and when i click on that image it zooms in. 3. the recent videos i download dont appear when i check images.	bug report

Cannot send anything. Constantly losing network.	bug report
Works well on wifi network, but when I tried to activate the SIM card to use TextNow on the mobile network, it was not activated, I lost the access to my account, and four technical assistants could not help me.

It's good I just have a suggestion, you guys should add a new update that allows you to hide and unhide chats.

They charge you to receive verification codes by making you upgrade to premium to receive them. There are other apps that are free and don't charge for verification codes. Looks elsewhere first	feature request
Overall i like the app, especially since the browser on my phone dosnt support the website. But the last update (the one that removed the classic blue background/theme) is a little upsettting. Id personally like to either have a free theme added that has less contrast from text to background colors. (Like when a books pages yellow and take away the bright blinding white.) The old blue did this for us, but the new themes have no middle ground. Its kind of headache inducing	feature request
Pioneered a username system that made usernames more valuable to each individual and less valuable to everyone else. Then throws it away... Nice, what's next?	feature request

I'd rather not be forced into the big borg brain 24/7 by my employer, however I need to eat and pay rent. I wish group me didn't exist because management at several companies see it as the perfect tool to micromanage and harass employees by remote control. You get caught in a catch 22 with it. It's constantly blowing up the more people are in a group. There are no filter or search tools like email. All around sucks.	irrelevant information

App is fun to chat and meet with new people! There's just a problem, I haven't used my phone number but it says another user has. I can't talk on some servers because of this. Another thing, when making a new server and helping someone with it, there's just an issue. Only the owner can reorder roles and edit roles that have been selected as administrator. Although I've been given this role, I still can't do anything.	bug report

Works great when it does. However, what's the point of an app that is supposed to send you notifications when your friends message you, if such app log you out of your account all the time?... Each time I open it up, it asks for my login info AND my 2FA info as well. VERY annoying.	bug report

(Edited from 5 stars to 3) It's been a month now, and I'm still not used to the new layout. At first I thought it was a thing I'd get used to but it's just so unintuitive to navigate. Settings are hard to find, the member list is hidden away, you can't type filters into the search bar anymore, and swipe to reply is annoying and I never use it. it's just confusing and it went from enjoyable to use to a frequently annoying mess. Functionality is still there, so at least messaging still works.	feature request

The app updated today while I was in the middle of using it and the new layout is extremely user unfriendly. No longer can you keyword search in a dm to find a specific chat message, you are instead limited to media, pins, links, and files. They try to force you to swipe messages to reply while you scroll, and honestly the new layout just looks disorganized. The worst part is definitely the limited search options for dms.	feature request

This app is useful for chat messages and that's about it. Voice chat is completely broken. Has issues with mic and speaker output. Either doesn't hear me or echoes, especially on speaker. Tested on multiple phones and tablets at this point. Issue has persisted over the course of years. New UI is INCREDIBLY slow.

I would give this app zero starts right now if possible. You took a perfectly fine app and decided to make it worse. the transitions between screens are janky and glitched, swiping causes a whole host of issues, it's incredibly easy to accidentally delete messages, the discord team needs to pull themselves together and fix this. Just go back to "mirroring desktop UI"	bug report

This app worked really well, I could call text and send pictures. But there are A LOT of problems. First of all, the videos. I could only send 15 seconds of a video. Yet another one, their premium. Not only is it seemingly expensive, it spams you with pop ups constant. One more problem is the reasoning for account disabling. Several of my accounts have been disabled for the same reason, spamming my friend kept spamming me g do I did it back and my account got disabled. Please re enable my acc	bug report
On my new phone, cant. On my old phone and everyone elses it would have a huge delay between voices, like I would say something and it would reach the other party about 3-4 seconds later. It's almost unusable except in emergency	bug report
Lately I've found that in being added to recent groups and creating groups, I will add people or be added but then the group never works. I've been receiving notifications that say I've been added to a group but then can not find or open that group and furthermore, the same seems to be happening to people who I've added to groups. I hope this gets fixed, as I've previously very much enjoyed the app.	bug report
it's good but I keep getting a pop up which says "Oh no! an error occurred with your purchase" even though I didn't buy anything	bug report
I give it a 4 out of five stars because sometimes it glitches or just freezes to where u have to click the power button to turn it off and back on so it's sometimes sort of a struggle	bug report

Amazing, I've been using it for about 2 years now. It's almost perfect and having the ability to make servers is very cool. The one thing that I struggled with was getting my account back after it got disabled, someone reported me for being under 13 while I am not. I never ended up getting my account back, and the account had nitro which I was forced to continue to pay for. Other than that, it's amazing.	feature request

Discord as a whole is great. The app BEFORE THE UPDATE was great. But the new update is filled with bugs, is poorly designed, and overall just made things unusable.	bug report
This is probably the best platform out there that does this type of business. Only complains I have are it's glitches, such as when I undeafen while watching a YouTube video, it puts my discord call on phone speaker instead of my headphones, which caused an embarrassing problem a couple minutes ago.

For communication it's a great program. I give it a five out of 10. I don't really use this program but whenever you need help with something you know you can go to discord and they'll help you out. Especially if you're playing destiny the game. Discord is wonderful.	irrelevant information

So far , texting is all I've been able to do. The calling part has never worked for me, I know how to follow instructions & I have not made 1 connection out of 25 attempts at a call. I purchased the sim from TextNow in order to make calls without needing a WIFI connection (supposedly) but it apparently still needs 1 ü§¨ that's what the app is telling me. I only give 2 stars because there just might be something I am missing, a setting is off maybe, but I doubt it. I'll update review if needed.	bug report
Experiencing problems in call establishing connection in Skype. Sometimes bell is ringing on caller side but no ringing on the other end. Sometimes call connects and voice of the person on the other side is heard but the ringing doesn't stop. Sometimes call is established but only one person can hear the other cannot. Normally call is properly connected on 2nd or 3rd attempt. Please improve Skype. Still Skype is best in voice and video quality, so keeping four stars.	bug report

Works well most of the time, but this app has always been prone to random freezes, lag, and bugs. I've had issues with sending videos (which always seem greatly compressed), creating and deleting groups, leaving and joining groups.. all over the span of multiple phones and years. It's irritating.	bug report

The new version of the app has several issues so I am dropping my rating. It's slower - maybe we blame my device for that one - but it didn't used to run like this. It's a poor UX, requiring more steps/button presses to accomplish the same tasks. Finally, personally, I dont want to swipe to reply to people, I want to swipe left or right to see the various channels and users in those channels at that moment. That's more tedious to do now.

Really buggy, tons of notification issues, sometimes your group chats won't load at all. My friends and I have used it for over 5 years now and are heavily considering switching to a new app because of how buggy the app is. I want it to be good, but this app just frustrates me.	bug report
I could mention the things everyone is talking about with the new UI, but I don't care as much as the bugs. I cannot consistently send media files. Sometimes it will not show the send button, other times it'll work perfectly fine. Now the app won't change channels properly. Switching to a different one won't upate and will show the previous channel. I need to close the app everytim to fix this. Focus on actual features instead of releasing a broken build when nothing was wrong with the original.	bug report
What on earth have you done to Discord? The way the DMs now work is just awful..... The amount of taps and swipes I need just to see a profile now..... I mean inbox being at the bottom is a good idea, but Discord now doesn't respect my screen rotation settings? I tilt my phone just a little too far and BOOM landscape.... Also, the performance is really bad now. And no I don't wish to familiarise myself with how this is now. Please change this back....	feature request

Chats also don't save where you were in a conversation so you constantly have to scroll down again and again. Don't love the new update at all.	feature request

When everything is working, this app is great. However, there are way too many bugs to call it great overall. Ever since an update in late 2022, bugs have been a constant problem. Voice chat breaks randomly, load times are way too long, the option to turn of @'s doesn't show up, menus don't load, menus decide to open for no reason, I can keep going. Stop adding new features that aren't nessesary and start fixing the features that already exist!	bug report
Thus app is trash. Por connection. Don't download. Thus app doesent deserv the one star	bug report
The new UI makes things waay harder to moderate server because search is now channel based and can't be used globally(across multiple channels within the server). Video embed sometimes doesn't work and I had to restart discord to view it	bug report
Update March 2020: several of the major annoyances have been fixed, but I really wish the developers could use the older versions a bit to understand what is missing... Old review (1 star): The last update is so bad it makes me look for alternatives. How could the developers Not test if Bluetooth worked? With this release I have to take off my headset to answer calls. Also - calls are not hung up since the disconnect isn't clearly visible anywhere...	bug report

The new UI changes has made it a lot more timeconsuming and harder to move between servers and DM's, which means I not only miss out on messages more often but also have to excessively tap around withouth the quick swipe. On top of that, it has become more tedious to quickly access the member list on the servers too. These changes has just made the experience less streamline and pleasant. Between this and the annoying, constant nitro advertisement, Discord is making itself more unattractive.	feature request
Amazing tool for education. I use a discord server to put down my notes, although it would be nice if I can edit sent images since I know I can use it for college. The thing is, some of the images are classified, private images of my friends' faces, and it can be dangerous studying in private areas. Recommendation: Please allow an option to edit sent images in a discord server	feature request

I use discord to talk to all of my friends. However- this UI update is. not great. It gets rid of the original experience, and even gets rid of features like looking at your friends list (which I personally loved doing). Now it's tucked away into a new format. Notifications are now a priority, and I don't know a single soul who uses that feature. I get what the vision was, but sometimes sleek isn't always better. I wish there was a way to at to put the friends list where notifications are.	feature request

Mobile client is ok. The desktop client I'd give a 4.5/5.

Oh and calling on mobile is pretty terrible, it mutes everything sometimes. WHY can't it just use your phones default font?!?!	bug report

The latest update has made the app almost unusable. It takes forever for servers to load, often thinks channels (including those from my personal server) are marked as read only, lags horribly when switching between servers, and oftentimes doesn't show any indication of a new DM - and that's just a handful of the issues since the update. The new interface is horrendous and hides away what had once been easy to locate info. Not a good look.	bug report

The desktop program is still fine, it's the same it's been for years. The mobile app is what I have an issue with, the new update in particular. Buggy, slow, it doesn't show notifications properly for DMs and made it harder to know if someone messaged you, and they have removed options and put in newer ones that were unnecessary. Until there is an option to revert back to the stable version from prior, I have no desire to support their mobile app.	bug report

Works great about 50% of the time, locks you out and randomly drops calls the rest of the time with no explanation and zero help from the app's authors. Also, authors constantly spam me with ads for their service, but won't offer service in my area. It's like getting a giant middle finger right in the face. Finally, poor (to the point of nonexistent) tech support and over-reliance on junk "helpbots" that are no help at all. To the authors: Don't count on ever getting five stars from me.	bug report

Update: They made the area where you wrote messages smaller... Definitely made the experience worse. I'd rate this lower if I could. I've been using Discord since 2016. The mobile app has just been updated and these changes are terrible. Swipe to reply replaces swiping to see online members of a server, images and media don't show up in pins. Discord doesn't allow you to switch to the old layout. Don't download this. I'd rather use the browser version instead.	feature request

Discord is a perfectly fine app for communication if you're 18 or older. I don't suggest it for anyone under 18 as some users are unsafe.

Discord..what have you done?! This new update is horrible! You have completely changed what I have known so well for many years to something i can not even navigate with ease. Bring back the old layout Please! Edit: After finally finding out how to get to the settings after 15min of fumbling to find it, i found the disable new layout.. Still, the old layout needs to be default, and better explained how to navigate..don't change what people are familiar with....	feature request

Was at 4 stars when I first reviewed it and it was great for about 4 years. With the removal of sms messaging, the app serves no purpose. No longer recocommend.. it "doesn't make sense".. who wants a secure app that you have to convince people to download just to talk too.. Smh	feature request

Why won't you change it back, it's literally the worst now üò≠	bug report
Works great and your now taken down for saying the truth	irrelevant information
I like it but I don't. I like that I can call my friends and text them. I don't like it for two reasons. The first reason is that you can't call an emergency number off of it, and that isn't good if you have a tablet like I do because it doesn't come with a phone, so you have to rely on  texting apps like this one. I also don't like it because it takes away a minute a day, and because you have to watch videos to get minutes of talking time, so you have to text more than talk.	feature request

Used this app for years. It was great. I recruited several family members and friends. However, most of my contacts do not use Signal. And by dropping support for SMS, I have to uninstall this app. I will not use two messenger apps. Google Messages seems to be the most convenient and secure at the moment with RCS... Ugh, but more personal info for Google...	feature request
Good but I constantly open the app and go to immediately write a message so click on the chat box and just as I do a pop up will come up resulting in me immediately dismissing it without ever being able to see what it was this happens all the time and really needs to be fixed just a slight delay before u can click a dismiss button or whatever is on the pop up would be perfect as otherwise I'm never gonna know what these popups are even asking	bug report

I'm sorry, but the new update for mobile is not an Improvement, its made it harder to navigate, harder to realise who messaged you, and so on. And why change what people are used to!? Not only that, it took me ten minutes to find settings! On top of that, you made it take more time to make channels on mobile? This isn't an update. And I really think you need to re think this update. Go back to the old way discord mobile was. It was far, far better.	feature request

Been using discord since 2016 (6 years). This is an edit to update my review, the latest UI has many bugs, I personally don't mind the new layout, however as usual there are about 6 unsolved bugs that don't get recognized for weeks, almost a month now, plus the insane increase in the latest issues server-side. I do like using discord but at the moment my opinion remains unchanged especially regarding the amount of bugs.	bug report
Scam app. Forces you to pay after you use it for a verification code. Clear extrotion. Your response is completely tone deaf and ignores the issue. You do not disclose anywhere on the app store that verification codes require a subscription.	bug report
Not really sure	irrelevant information
Verification for messages This app has made it a nightmare to log onto. I had an emergency that required me to change phone numbers!!! I didn't have time to update from my old number with my established apps. I've had a time verifying my number with my bank, credit cards, and even Google, but they all were quick to verify me within a matter of days. I never thought a messaging app would take months.... MONTHS! To verify that i wish to change phone numbers. Absolutely not worth it.	bug report
Since the recent update, the GUI is FAR less intuitive, and I have had about 20x the amount of bugs, ranging from messages not loading, messages not sending, messages sending 3+ times without processing client side, to complete and random crashes. I don't know what idiot needed to justify their existence at this company, but fire them and do a rollback.	bug report

WHO'S IDEA OF PHASING OUT SMS SUPPORT?! All my family and friends are deleting the app, as the SMS opcion was one of the main reason they wanted a good app that unified both texting options.

Every update is not a bug-fix, but introduces more and worse bugs. Discord, do us a favor and stop developing and updating. We don't need useless features accompanied with bugs that makes all server channels inaccessible. The only updates should be security updates. I really like(d) Discord, if only there weren't these updates. No access to server channels after update. Every channel became marked as unread, affecting desktop discord as well. Discord: 2-5 years ago: 5/5 now: 2/5 soon: 1/5?	bug report
Good lord, who came up with the new UI? Not only is this one less intuitive, it also stutters when changing tabs. Please change it back.	bug report

If this problem could be fixed this would be a superb app, and would definitely receive five stars. Thanks.	bug report

Seemed to work one issue however I waited on the "Free Version" to receive a text message.

I've been using skype for long time, with same device, it turns out at the moment, skype is very much heavier than other IM I'm using, it's lagging (switching from chat to chat, opening emoticons, etc.), I'm not going to upgrade my device so skype can operate fluidly, other IM I'm using like LINE, WhatsApp, Telegram, works fine without lagging.	bug report

Bugging bro after the update , come on fix it 2022 / the new update makes more worse, within 10s the app closes itself 2023	bug report
This app is not dependable. It will freeze while an incoming call is on your screen so you cannot press Answer nor Reject. The app will also restart mid call. I hate that the app is starting to do things like this regularly. For awhile I had it with no issue. But I guess the app is for short calls. Not built to handle a full conversation. :(	bug report
The images won't download half the time. I've re-download the app multiple times just randomly stops	bug report
Does not function properly in calls. It works fine if I do absolutely nothing, but if for whatever reason I need to close the app or multitask while in a call, the app breaks, and more often than not will disrupt normal navigation of my phone. It's incredibly frustrating given that it used to work just fine. It's sad to see an app fall so far.	bug report
I would prefer if it better integrates with the phone book, i.e. that I can select from my phone book to route a call through Skype... The interface is also a bit messy.	feature request

Signal used to be simple and clean but now it has become a glitchy mess as a result of trying to compete with apps like WhatsApp.	bug report
Hello yes it charges 4.99 , I think I deleted your app bc it required me to pay for calls.Here's .You advertise your app for free; it's 4.99 texting and free calling ,my butt the other glitch is I've not made any calls or texts and your app claims I've exceed my limit.!!

Awful forced UI update that made everything pointlessly confusing, constantly overheats phone(no issues at all with heat on any other app), and near constantly crashes my phone completely when trying to flip the camera around when video calling, absolute joke of an app now, been forced to download an older version of the app now to make it bearable again. Stop forcing pointless features and updates that no one wants and maybe fix this dog awful app finally.	bug report

Always been a great app, my main way of talking with friends for years. The new update makes Discord worse than before, but I don't mind it. One thing I do find annoying though is that ever since it came out, a few profile pictures (including my own) haven't been appearing and the friends list is now quite hard to navigate through. Other than that, great app.	feature request

It also has been taking my mintues and it want let me watch videos to earn mintues anymore! What happened!	bug report
This makesall other messaging apps look like a few rank amateurs had a crack at developing a bit of code. Its features and stability have been biblical, and the windows client just completes the suite beautifully. Its intuitive interface and distinct lack of any ill judged advertising attempts make it a clear winner in any messaging apps comparison.	irrelevant information
I often found connection problem in this application while calling to someone	bug report
I use the app on mobile a lot and I like the communites there. I'm mainly writing this review to point out a few bugs though. Firstly it has a problem with my phones flipped screen. If the open was opened while my screen was flipped and it's back to normal it splits media and doesn't display the channels and voicecalls at the bottom of my screen if I don't scroll down to view them. Also sometimes there are some channels missing at the bottom.	bug report
Since the useless update, it keeps glitching out for me. Messages don't load in, sometimes i have to uninstall and reinstall just for something to work, the theme is broken, the screen glitches and i can't hit my buttons because they overlap with the samsung buttons at the bottom, things are moved around and iverall more difficult to navigate.	bug report
I've been using the new UI/UX for a couple of weeks now and it is quite simply a complete and utter downgrade in every sense of the word. Now before Discord start on this "you just need to get used to it" nonsense - I have used it every day since it released. It's bad. Things that were once easy to find have been tucked away in submenus, navigation is less intuitive and honestly? It's ugly. Not to mention the accessibility issues of making dark mode worse for many users by making it hig contrast	feature request
fairly decent	irrelevant information

Buggier than a rotten log.

I've been a paying customer of discord for years now. Never have I come closer to discarding the app entirely before this last update. It's buggy, ugly, and ruins so many great aspects of discord past. Going into my settings crashes the entire app. It's laggy and snaps to the new area instead of the slow, smooth pan it used to have. I will be cancelling my nitro subscription until this is fixed.	bug report

This used to be a great app until the UI update last year. Ever since then discord has been extremely buggy on Android and almost a year later these issues persist, I am not able to send something as basic as a video without the audio getting replaced with a loud static. It's embarrassing how something like this gets past quality control, but I guess this joke of an app is here to stay as most users have just accepted it and discord has no pressure to fix this app. Just unacceptable.	bug report
not sure why but recently i haven't been able to see another persons camera (infinite loading loop) whenever they've been on, but mine works fine. i can see the cameras on the desktop version but not on the app at all.	bug report
2 months ago this app was great. No need to change at all. Are you trying to be retarded by upgrading this??? Pending friend requests do not show. Must use computer to see them. Wish i could revert to last version on mobile. Sucks.	bug report
Discord is a really good app for chatting, making friends and stuff but there's this one issue I've been facing recently, there's this one specific server that whenever I enter it, my Discord crashes. I've reinstalled the app to see if I could enter the server without Discord crashing and it worked. It only worked for 4-7 minutes and then after that it started crashing again. Please fix this.	bug report
App barely works most of the time, react native broke pretty much all the features that a community app needs.

Signal has been my default text messaging app, going back to 2012 when it was named TextSecure. Sadly I've uninstalled the Signal app and have changed to a different texting app. I understand that dropping support for SMS and MMS is a security decision but I still need to be able to communicate with all the other people who are using different text messaging services. SMS/MMS are very dated and limited but they're the only common standards that all those other texting apps still support.	irrelevant information

The UI of this app has become buggy to the point of being unusable in recent months.

It works but I can't delete any messages so now I have a message from some random girl (along with a picture of her huge backside) asking me about nude pictures. I archived it but it still shows up on my phone. Makes no sense why I can't delete things I don't want to see.	bug report
Honestly, the latest update has its pros but more cons, its lame than before, The members list has been moved, the notification thing looks ugly and everything is circular, its becoming the same as any other messaging app now. It truly sucks.	feature request
This app is not good for more than 6 people interacting. The layout of the people's windows seems very messy. If it is more than 6 people then the rest 2-3 people are visible in small round windows. And if it is more than 9 people then you won't be able to see more than 8 people, just audio. Atleast you should be able to select the people, whose a/v you want to see, because there is no way to select the people whose video you want to see. Hopefully someone will take care of this.	feature request
It takes time to sign up....	feature request
currently using Samsung Galaxy S23, and ive found that whenever i open the app through a notification, pictures in the chat dont get formatted properly, cutting off partially on the right side. but more importantly, so does the emojiboard. i have to close and reopen the app to fix it, but it's bothersome that i cant access half of my frequently used emojis cause the UI reaches further than my phone screen goes. just to clarify- my phone's emojiboard is fine, it's specifically the in-app one.	bug report
Since 2016 I've been using Discord since 2016. I've been through all the changes but Nitro was the worst one. Pay for this, pay for that. It's okay to pay for a customisable profile. But sending specific emotes? It was already an option back then, plus now you can pay to make your app icon look "cool" though this is something anyone can do with any app. A lot of paywalls just for money making. Like I'm glad I can still at least use the app for free. Let's see if that changes.	feature request

The "new mobile experience" is clunky. It's unintuitive for new and old users. I no longer swipe left to see the server member list, no, that makes me reply.

I'm actually very upset with the new updates to discord. The app used to be so nice to use and wouldn't look ugly. They removed their dark dark mode and now it's just this weird grey. You could unlock the dark dark mode if you pressed dark mode 10 times, but they don't have that anymore. I don't like the new font either, and the logo. I wish we could go back to discord's original state, when things weren't so ugly and finicky to use.	feature request

Don't get me wrong, discord is a well established platform, but all of these verification things make it hard for me to simply log in. I do not have access to my email I attached to my main account, so I try and use my phone number but it still tells me to check my email. I know this is only for safety, but they could tone it down a knotch. Also, the new updates have been a pain for me. Aside from all of this, Discord is a good communication platform, I definitely recommend it.	feature request
I am relieved I didn't pay for Nitro, since the latest app change that was updated on my device without my permission, has decreased my overall interaction with the app due to the various changes that other reviewers also stated, and making me learn new methods of doing things that I don't have time to learn. Thanks developers for saving me money üòÅ	feature request

The past week using discord on my Samsung Galaxy tab8 Ultra in a voice channel I am constantly getting disconnected from the call, but it doesn't actually kick me out. I can still hear everything everyone is saying but they cannot hear me. I have updated the discord app and my tablet to make sure it's not on my end. It cannot be my internet because I can still hear everyone perfectly fine. discord nitro is already an absolute waste of $10 a month but with this issue I am canceling until fixed.	bug report

Too much slow, Very bad. Couldn't enter into the sign in page. Just showing loading.	bug report
I love some of the features of this app, having the ability to make calls and text from an actual phone number. However, on both incoming and outgoing calls it drops like 95% of the time. I can hear the other person, but they can't hear me. This usually happens within 5 minutes of making the call, regardless of the strength of my Wi-Fi. It's very annoying, if this issue was resolved I would definitely rate 5 stars.	bug report

Update: recently, within the past 1.5 months, I have have 4 instances where the app would not download messages from a group chat, or send any messages to the group chat. This isn't acceptable. I'm hoping to hear back from support about this being fixed. Additionally, it seems that Signal is no longer supporting SMS messages? This means that to text a non-Signal user, you have to use a different messaging app. That's very annoying and inconvenient. Why would you do this?	bug report
Great to communicate with people all around the world.	irrelevant information
There was still this bug in October 2023 (updating or restarting the app fixed it for now..) where sometimes the chat content gets stuck on one chat even if you try to open another channel to see its content. Same bug has been there a year or two ago. The indicator about someone typing seems to update accordingly though.	bug report
While I have had an account with Skype practically since the original debute of the service, I am going to have to restrict it's use to just my laptop for now.

Yikes, they pushed an update in December that resigned the app and it's awful. It takes multiple seconds to launch, even when it's already open, it stalls between selecting servers, and I encountered a repeatable bug where photos I'm attempting to upload to a server were silently shared in a DM. No way to opt out, and there is not a single response about concerns in their support forum.	bug report

Been using this app for quite sometime and loved it no issues at all.  Calls were excellent.

CLEARLY THIS IS THE SERVICE LETTING U THINK UR GETTING FREE MINUTES WHEN I  REALITY YOU ARE USING UP THOSW FREE MINUTES WITH THEIR SPONSORED CRAP.  I CALL THE NUMBERS BACK AND THEY WONT CONNECT.  I ANSWERED 2 CALLS JUST TO SEE WHO IT WAS.  HIGHER EDUCATION, I DID NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS!  I EMAILED YOU GUYS TWICE WITHIN THE LAST WEEK AND NO RESPONSE.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.

This app is stupid doesn't giv me notifications that i got messages till i hav about 10 messages should update it or make a real app if your gonna make 1!!!	bug report
Unfortunately removing SMS support/integration had made this app unusable for me. I spent months getting people to use it, but because everyone I know that used it has less than 10% of their contacts on Signal, they've made the decision to use different apps.

Horrible call experience!

This app does fine with SMS. It has a problem with receiving MMS from non-Signal apps. I have tested with 5 phones -- 2 on android 8, 1 on 9, and 2 on 11. These were with 2 carriers -- at&t and Verizon. All have the latest update of Signal. All of the phones receive MMS when not using Signal. All receive MMS with Signal when it is from another phone using Signal. None can download MMS images from a non-Signal app when using Signal even after following Signal Help. Do a search - it's not just me.	bug report

When you updated the UI the first time time, it was weird but still ok. when you updated the UI this time, it was so disgusting and hard to look at that I forcefully reverted it back to the old layout.

The one issue that exists is, when I want to share photos or videos, it asks for storage permission by which this app will have access to all of my media, which I don't feel is necessary, Android OS provides an option to let pick selected media without having to access all the media on device.

Great calling/chatting app, discord allows me to do wonderful things tbh, I love how they allow GIF'S that are already installed onto the phone. Although I have a minor issue that I think they need to upgrade or fix. When calling I can hardly hear the person I'm talking to, either the call makes voice cracks or the call just immediately cuts off their voice out of nowhere, tbh being on vc on Roblox just seems to be more clear, nothing against this app. I just feel like they need to fix this.ü´∂	bug report

A lot of spam msg	irrelevant information
New update on mobile is causing HUGE lagging issues, and is way less efficient - you used to be able to mostly swipe your way through the app, but pivoting between chats and servers has added unnecessary bulk. I could maybe have gotten used to it if it was as fast as the previous UI, but it seems like the change has negatively impacted loading speeds and caused glitches in switching between servers.	bug report
Was nice while it lasted	irrelevant information
its awesome	irrelevant information
Absolutely sucks! I can't even delete my account	bug report
I rarely had any issues with this app before the most recent update. The update didn't even break anything to my knowledge, they just changed most of the ui and made it much more difficult to find the features I'm looking for. Why discord? There was nothing wrong with the way your app worked before, and there was no reason to overcomplicate the user experience. I've been using discord since 2016 and each pointless update makes me wish for a worthwhile competitor more and more.	feature request
Only thing it needs is for it to notify me when someone is calling then it would be perfect.	feature request

aweful experience with the new UI. Everything is so big that i cannot even push the submit button when writing something. Fewer features than the previous version too. Terrible.	feature request
The new discord layout is awful and I wish I'd never updated. They've forced all your private chats onto one tab which means I can't close any of them. I have all my chats muted and I was able to tell new messages came in when one popped up. Now I can't do this and I'm just not answering people because it's too overwhelming to have every message and every friend I've talked to recently on one tab. I'll be uninstalling discord and loading an old version in a way that is less legal but o well	feature request

Calling feature is not great, connection is very poor. Texting is alot better but a few times I sent a text and it did not go through and I be wondering why I didn't receive a text back in a timely matter, so I have to remove it then install it again just to see that my message didn't go through.	bug report
I can't describe any experience because I have not used this app much. The only reason I gave only 4 stars is because it was not secure enough according to the report I read. I am hoping to be able to use only this app soon. This is what I wrote now I am disappointed because they for some reason have not been able to attract more people. I have invited many but they don't join.	irrelevant information
Tried scanning an invite qr code. Would not scan no matter what I did. Then I tried to join using a link. Asked me to sign in, then loaded for a second and went back to the sign in page. Never added me to the group. UPDATE/SOLUTION: problem is because of an update with Android 12 and link handling. GroupMe has not updated their website verifying their links with the app, so it will simply do nothing. You have to manually enable link opening in your device settings for the app. FIX THIS!	bug report
A bit harder than I thought to manuever. Plus way to many ads.	irrelevant information
Pretty good, it's easy to use, however if you're in a channel it tends to glitch badly. You're still in the channel, but you can't read or respond. Usually its fixed by uninstalling and reinstalling, but that gets old fast. Update: same problem still and I've uploaded two support requests	bug report
Slow loading on both wifi and mobile data	bug report
It shows something went wrong please try again later everytime i signup,. And when i finally signed up it showed no number available to show please try again later.... I made show many accounts and they all later showed your account had violated our terms so is banned, like seriously all they want is to create more n more accounts and that's it, this app has severely becoming useless, not worth at all.	bug report
Can you please give an update that prevent the app from lagging and crashing after continuous usage?	bug report
New update for mobile isn't that great. It lags when going between servers and private DMs. When you pull up your private DMs, there is a noticeable delay between when you click the chat area to type to when you start typing.	bug report
I love signal, but it's going downhill. It doesn't need to be a social media app. We don't need stories. We do need to be able to send SMS messages. I will likely not continue using Signal if I can't message half of my contacts with it.	feature request

Very often calls don't appear as someone is calling, there is no ringing. Also messages, when I unlock the phone then suddenly I get 5 messages at once. And when using Android Auto, an incoming call is ringing but visually no button to answer the call.

Discord mobile has been okay but with the recent update, where the ui was changed, it became slower to navigate. Changing conversations between servers and dms used to be quick but since they've "seperated" them, it takes a while (especially to load in). I can no longer ring people in private calls multiple times (unless i havent found that option again) and calls aren't automatically on speaker unlike before where I'm used to. Aesthetics are nice but it just became slower.	bug report

I've enjoyed Signal for years, but now that it's ending SMS support, it's going to be virtually useless for me. I believe in what Signal stands for but I'm not a fan of asking people to download other apps to contact me when SMS is the easiest way for a lot of people. Honestly, I used it mainly for the interface. I'd even be willing to pay a small monthly fee to keep SMS support. I'll give it a 2nd star for giving plenty of notice that SMS support will be ending.	feature request

Always glitchy. Won't send email or phone password reset links. Can't merge accounts or change email account. All it says is contact your admin. Messages don't go through, the app is very limited and seems to struggle a ton with simple tasks. It seems like an app made in the 80s, the pictures won't go through in a easy and clean way, they're pixalated and messaging isweird. You cant leave a group without being an admin, and you have to unlock and do these manual details to allow people to join	bug report

This app has been great during my college years for groups that I've been in to always be in quick communication.	irrelevant information
Worst experience ever. Verification process does not work, despite confirming successfully. Support is slow, online help content is extremely limited, and ads are intrusive. Ad support is not unacceptable, but rendering the app unusable actually is. I will be uninstalling. EDITED : Your reply did not help. You misunderstood my point. It was YOUR mobile app (and the browser experience) that was requesting that I validate who I am via a dialer to a phone number that I was to provide to YOU. I did this using multiple numbers, but it never actually called three of the four I tried. It only worked with one of those four numbers and, despite saying that it was successful, the app STILL did not allow me to send or receive texts. As much as I really wanted to use and like this app, it was a poor experience with a poor client interface on both the mobile and desktop platforms.	bug report

I do use Skype quite often but it is not like it used to be. chat logs aren't as easily retrievable and oftentimes the status of friends is not accurate, saying they are not online when they are, or showing away for hours when its been only minutes. sometimes messages are delayed in delivery. still, overall I prefer it to other messaging services.	bug report

Got an update where the entire UI is reworked. There is no reason for this, and the old version looked and functioned just fine. The new version has four buttons at the bottom, each of which causes extra work to get to where you want, only showing your four most recent servers, and adding an additional step to get to the others. The result is a confusing labyrinth for any user to get to where they want. But wait, there's more. The channels within each server are reworked terribly as well.	feature request

The new UI is anti-accessibility, broken and unusable, and is insulting to all who use the mobile Discord app. QoL functions have been removed or made far harder to access and bugs make the app borderline unusable.

I encourage others to not spend a dime on this service, and to revert their app to an older version for their own convenience (or to simply not update if they have not received the changes).	bug report

I love discord, fun to use and a great way to contact friends and meet people, but recently the subscriptions have been all wonky. They say they would be gone but are still there like 2 days later. For example, my subscription was supposed to be gone on the 7th for overdue payment, it's the 9th. It'sa problem because I want to get a different subscription, but it won't let me. Fix this!	bug report
Used to love this app, but now I'm quite disappointed, it's not consistent, hardly ever get notified of incoming calls or text, miss calls or text sometimes show up days later if at all.	bug report

Issues for devs you look at: No video or photo compressing unless you pay for nitro.. that's just cheap. Randomly scrolls long conversations when you switch out of the app, so you lose where you were if you're catching up. Poor chat and channel organisation and notification management so it's more or less impossible to get a proper feed. Can't handle one account using both mobile and desktop simultaneously.	bug report
Updated January 2024: I had hoped Discord would revert the UI change, but it's been a month and they seem more intent on replying with stock messages to reviews. I've reverted to an older version and will not update. And as for giving feedback on the website, I'll do so just as soon as a moderation team is put in place to collate identical posts and remove spam. That's not a new issue either.	feature request

Mobile UI is now awful. Absolutely awful. I've tried to adjust for weeks and I cannot express how inconvenient and horrible the simplest and little of things are. I'd give 5 stars if it went back to how everything was before this update. I can't even in good conscious give this 2 stars for it still being perfect on desktop because this sets a bad precident. Don't fix what isn't broken. Go back and start adding user tools for ui customization that doesn't break app if you want this change so bad.	feature request

Unfortunately with this new update the app keeps hanging up when i am in a call some times it dosent let me use the number keys to make an option on a call operater. I dont recive calls but i do get the voice mails . Sometimes it doesn't make the call at all. This app use to be great i had no problems other then having to be next to my wifi connection so people can hear me over the phone. But i didnt mind as long as i can get through to them.Now i have to make a quick call. Or it will hang up. Hope they can fix this problem soon	bug report

Normally works but spotty	bug report
Use to be a good app till the more recent updates. It can take several minutes to actually connect if you don't have internet/phone data that's fast enough. Sometimes it won't let me connect at all. Photos and videos also take an extremely long time to load.	bug report

I love that I can use this as my my main texting, even with people who don't have this app.	feature request
This has been working but the last few day sit downloaded so i rey am liking this so far	irrelevant information
I've been using this app since 2017. The latest update was horrible in terms of usability and accessibility, and I can't stand it. The only free color options hurt my eyes with contrast, and I'm not paying a monthly subscription of $10 in order to text people. Many features were also hidden behind weird menus and unintuitive layouts, when they were previously easy to access. I set this app to never auto-update and these changes pushed through regardless. I hate it. No one asked for this.	bug report
Does not ring (make sound) at all, can't figure out how to turn up the ringer. Worked once. Unreliable, and is deceptive as a reliable app, and does waste your time!!	bug report
Amazing except the fact that it kept saying my password was incorrect	bug report
There are instances when someone is calling, it does not ring on my end and it's automatically routed as missed call. I hope this will be fixed.	bug report
Why bother using it in 2022 when you have Discord, TeamSpeak, WhatsApp, Messenger, iMessage (w/ FaceTime), etc. Current builds make Skype literally worse than the good old days.	irrelevant information

Right now its a 2/5 for me chief, discord mobile is broken.

I have been using Skype ever since it got released and i used to love it until a while after Microsoft bought it. It has simply gone downhill since then with basically every update. The main reason im writing this review is because of status-issues though. It simply cant seem to keep the status i set on my desktop or phone, it changes to online after some time (its random sometimes) The really weird thing is that a few days ago, i chabged to "away" on my desktop, opened it on the phone and it should keep the same status, but it changed to online automatically. So, i change to away on the phone as well but in the morning when i get up its online on my desktop even if still away on the phone. So, i change to away on the desktop again, goes back into phone (still away) goes back to my homescreen and booom it goes online on my desktop! I mean seriously? this status-issue has been going on for years now and it cant be that freaking hard to fix it. If i want to have my status as away i should be able to until i manually change it and not become online at random. Not so fun to randomly become online at say 4 in the morning and people think that you are online and sends messages/calls. I have had lots of patience through the years but ill be switching to Telegram unless this thing is fixed. Its a bit sad since for me the call and audio/videoquality in skype is great.	bug report

The App is really glitchy with new features. Now if I remove someone and even delete the message thread.... They still show up at the top and I can't remove them. Like this weird status box of anyone that ever messaged you even when not added, removed, or deleted messages. The only way I can think to hide this is block them.... It shouldn't come down to that. Breaking the App... About to uninstall & use PC only.. If at all.	bug report
Purchased credits and it did not come through .. I needed to make an important call and tech team is unreachable.. what kind of service is that?!?	bug report

Great social app, but with social app you would expect some good community support? Especially when your platform relies HEAVILY on the users. WRONG. It's been over a month and a half and i'm still waiting for results from my raid report!

From 5 to 2. Discord has become a platform I wouldn't use if there were better options.

Don't like they cut your conversation off if the other party is not a contact with signal too well you can only invite people and if they don't respond to it nothing else i can do and signal doesn't allow you to continue to chat with them after so long and the main reason we fet signal is gor privacy so it forces you to go back and chat on default messaging...so no not completely satisfied.	bug report

The new layout is a bit overwhelming. Previously, it was a few, if not, just 1 click to get to my recent chat messages from the last person I texted. Now it takes about 2 or 3 clicks. Videos are for some reason 4:3 ratio, when most users videos are 1:1 ratio, or landscape; this cuts off a lot of the video, and makes it feel incredibly zoomed in. When resizing the app, everything but the video is responsive, when previously it was. Overall I feel the video calls ui need more attention	bug report

Let me start by saying I've been using discord since 2016 and love it. Sadly the developers find it necessary to bombard its users with ads for its premium service Nitro‚Ñ¢. Nitro seems cool, but stop blasting me with ads for it- if I wanted ads I'd go to Youtube. Recent updates have frequently seen connection issues, and the newest UI is a downgrade for organizing conversations and servers. This app is currently a big part of many communities, and I hope these issues are addressed soon.	feature request
Skype been stable so far on my new phone but still needs some reliability improvements especially in the message list page	bug report
Mobile app seems to have problems showing and syncing with chat channels and messages. Notifications will show up but not actually update within the channel view	bug report
I have been regularly using Discord since 2017, and I've paid for Nitro since 2022. This newest UI update is, in my opinion, the absolute worst update I've ever seen. It is not intuitive, it changes almost every feature that made Discord accessible, and it now looks nothing like the format of desktop Discord, which is something that previously made the mobile app so nice to use. I'm also considering ending my Nitro subscription, as I don't feel like paying $10 a month for an app I hate using.	feature request

No problem from signal!!!! But people are obsessed with whatsapp...... One issue is : add instant lock feature in the app.	feature request
They ditched SMS so I had to use other messengers as well and of course like most people found that to be inconvenient so deleted this app even though I liked it. For sure gonna kill this app making that change	irrelevant information

I don't always receive my messages in a timely fashion	bug report
Edit: 12Dec2022 - Dropping to one star. Why do I need to relink to devices after an update?? I can't see messages sent from one device on another. It may be because messages are not retained on servers by Signal once they've been delivered. But come on!! Prev. Edit 2021: Dropped it from 5 to 2 stars. 1. Lost messaging history after upgrade. 2. Continual FORCED upgrades. Unable to use app without upgrading. 3.Need to resync with laptop after each upgrade. One step away from uninstalling!	bug report

Constantly deletes all my server channels from my UI for no reason	bug report
When I first got this app, I did a test text and it went through and the person was able to text me back. I was notified that people weren't getting my text until days later. Then a lot of my messages never were sent. Would not recommend.	bug report

Used to work great but recently logs me out for no reason and refuses to log me in again!!

Very very annoying	bug report
Really like using this app for chatting, but the new interface killed everything that we know about discord... Specially some features like being able to see server members which is now more annoying to look for	feature request
Excellent connection. Great video sharing and international texting	irrelevant information
New UI from November 23 update is confusing, glitchy and overall a mess. It no longer matches the PC version. Uninstalled. Discord is trying to be less unique and alienating longtime users with these poor updates and useless design choices with no option for older appearance style. Also the new theme colors, while fun, are not accessible for those with vision problems.	feature request

Over all experience is 7 out of ten. I'm not much of a teach guy. My only issue was being hacked. I received many undirected calls thrue this app. And also tunting ads that where Directed towards me personally. It was an obvious hack. If not the hack 10/10	bug report

Not perfect anymore, new update release a horrible layout for mobile and it has been truly disgusting.

Clear and dependable connection. I love it!	irrelevant information
Rarely used the app now, lots of things changed and barely talk to friends, maybe I'll try and get used to discord been around since 2019 and now I'm unactive, Imma try my hardest to stay active on this crazy app	irrelevant information
Getting more laggy and stuttery per update but it's good overall	bug report
Was a great encrypted app until they started requiring all parties to have it in order to text. What about half my friends who can't/won't get Signal for one reason or another? I just won't be able to text them? Ridiculous requirement, I think you'll lose many users because of this.	feature request
perfect for group projects or a social club. my only complain is that some features are not souser friendly such as deleting old messages or groups	feature request
Ok It's alright in the beginning to showed my messages but now it doesn't show my messages when I want to view them. How am I supposed to replie to a message I can't see.	bug report
Signal is about to stop supporting SMS - creating a silo and terrible user experience. Not everyone can use Signal, but at least having SMS support I could use this as my default messaging app.	feature request
I no longer trust this app, The eliminated its independent lock, and now the program is completely dependent on Google services framework to function. I do not believe that Signal is secure any longer. But I know that it doesn't function without Google that's enough to consider it trash. I would recommend Element to anyone looking for secure, encrypted, open source communications that doesn't rely on Google Framework	bug report
I'm uninstalling this app it dont work right and stops responding a lot, keeps dropping calls and doesn't accept verification codes my phone service is shut off and this being my only number right now so it makes it useless when I can't get verification codes because everything need a phone verification to not have that on this app is the most stupidest thing anyone could do.	bug report

The redesign is fine, but it's still a god-awful mobile app. Discord is an app for calls. Yet it doesn't work on the background or with the screen off with basic power saving on (which isn't a problem for Telegram or Whatsapp), and if I turn off battery saver and go do something in the background, it just stops randomly after a while without notice. Also, why does it start a call to a Bluetooth device as an output when there's nothing connected?	bug report
Fun app. Times out at times but all in all good performance.	bug report
I love the app, but it is no longer going to support SMS messaging unless everyone is on signal. I can no longer use it for some of my friends.	feature request

The app no longer allows me to watch videos to gain minutes. They are TRYING to FORCE Me to Upgrade and PAY For the service. I Am No Longer Happy!!!	bug report
Nope not right choice , pass this one up in my opinion bogus too much hassle . Never got it to function properly	bug report
I sent an email quite a few days ago, but have yet to receive any help. There isn't an icon nor a setting re voicemail like is shown in the help section, so I'm not able to receive calls.

A solid secure messaging application. Just learned that instead of making a white list for inbound SMS, Signal is dropping all SMS support. Signal can no longer be my default SMS application. Guess that means I will be forced to re enble Messenger and make it the default again. Disappointed. Two stars off.	bug report
Calling is really janky, and the functionality of using both the Android app and the PC app is pretty awkward, too.	bug report
Worst app in history I gave gave it 1 star because there's no option to give it a minus star. It lets you make calls but no one will be able to hear you. What was the point of this app for? Uninstalled immediately, not worth it	bug report
Removing the SMS feature is such a terrible idea. Now Signal becomes another in a sea of messaging apps that can't communicate with each other. What a mess.	feature request
This is supposed to be a text free app i have to pay 5 dollars for it every month what's up with that	feature request
New UI update killed my family	bug report
I have submitted a simple bug many times. But all I am done is asked foolish questions and solution rather team look into it. On Xiaomi phones, as soon as I install and login, no group or chat of mine shows. Unless someone tags me. To mates I show as added. Once I move to a custom rom like lineage and install group me everything appears. It sucks how the support helps.	bug report
Why does it connect to your SMS, get out of my life. It's like a dude your neutral with you met on the streets. He is cool, but he suddenly shows up in your dm constantly everything things happen in his group and you're involved. Like, keep it separate please.	irrelevant information
I'm having an issue with notifications right now. After one of the more recent updates my phone will show an icon that a message may be pending for signal but it won't notify me or download the message until I manually open the app. Would you please work to address this? I've checked all my settings and they appear to be correct.	bug report
I like the fact that it's private.	irrelevant information
I cannot make calls over wifi. I use to before, but not it period saying I have no signal when in fact the wifi is fully connected. Please fix this ..	bug report
I wasn't going to leave a review until the app asked me to. The new UI is awful and glitchy. I'll change my rating when they change it back or at least give the option to. I've been using Discord since 2016 and this has been the worst update I've seen. Change it back.	feature request
Its üëç	irrelevant information
The new update has some frustrating bugs. When entering a sercer channel, it inexplicably starts you a small distance away from the most recent messages so you have to scroll down to see the message. Personally, I strongly dislike the update and many friends have shared the sentiment. It's harder to navigate, is less user friendly and having the DMs on a completely separate tab is annoying.	bug report
The new design is good and all but this new UI is very difficult to use and navigate. For example, it was very difficult to search a keyword in mobile version. Nah, difficult is an understatement. Its IMPOSSIBLE to search for keyword because it shows none. And thats just a basic example of it, I don't even know the other issues that I haven't explored yet	feature request
So it's worked well so far! But the person I send messages to sometimes doesn't see my messages! I send at least 7 before they answer! It could be because they're on an apple device and I'm on an android but still it's agitating!!!	feature request

I used it on my Ipod and on my phone. I have been using this app for more than 3 years. I loved this app, but now I just hate it!! It's a waste of time and money when 2 seconds waste a minute. I won't be aware of a call until I get a missed called notification nor will i receive a text until a few hours later.	bug report
We use this as an employee chat group Seems to be working great.	irrelevant information
Why does a splash screen come up everytime I check Skype? I understand Nougat 7.0 and Marshmallow hibernate apps not in use but surely there is way to remove the stupid animation?! WhatsApp didn't do it. Since I sent from 5.1.1 in my old phone to 7.0 on new, and updated Skype, it's slow, and frustrating!	bug report
Latest update is buggy - sometimes, when I switch channels, it still displays messages from the previous channel. When this happens, I have to kill discord and start it again. Also, new ui is not comfortable and non intuitive. The only thing I love about this update is a black theme	bug report
It's awesome so far	irrelevant information
Will give 5 stars if someone can help me with an issue. Ive used text free before and this has never happened. I'm using it for calls since i just moved Into another state and have already purchased minutes. But the calls always end on 26 seconds. Any help?	bug report
It's been a great app for me because I didn't want an expensive phone plan. In the past I've had great luck with it and I've told friends about it. A few may be signing up lol! I truly don't understand why more people don't have it because it's great and it's so inexpensive. I really appreciate it, so thanks guys.

Had a full screen add come up, tried to click exit and apparently it was a download button. Seems like malware. Would not recommend the app. Edit in response to developers: it should be fine if you can write in something that asks the user to confirm the download. This would prevent malware disguised as an app from being downloaded by a download button hidden in an exit icon.	bug report
Edit 8/2018 - latest update made font size tiny! It is hard on my eyes and I'm going to have to quit squinting to use it if they don't fix it ASAP. Me changing will mean my whole family has to change. Former review - five star Love this app. Can be used on WiFi or mobile, so it's more versatile than texting. Small groups are great for things like figuring out which of 3 family drivers can pick a kid up from practice and at the same time let's the kid know who is on their way.	bug report
Really like it but it recently crashed and won't work anymore. Rebooted phone, cleared cache, just crashes when trying to start	bug report

I appreciate the server system and i like that this app is more free-speech-ish (If that's a word) than other apps but there is room for improvement. The fact i need to give phone number if i need more accounts is bad even when I've never been banned. But this is a free app and it does it's job well enough.

Good app, I guess. However, it takes up waaay too much space. Currently takes up to 306mb, so I'm uninstalling and installing so it takes up less space. I shouldn't have to do this. It deletes messages too, after an amount of time, yes, but that's still frustrating. Calls aren't good, they tend to end unexpectedly. Video quality is always bad, regardless of phone or wifi connection. The most frustrating thing is it never gives me notifications and I end up ignoring my friends. It's also very slow, and it takes a while to load up.	bug report

It's just so buggy and slow on a chromebook. It takes ages to pick up/hang up/ Close the app (Well maybe like 5s, but in 2018 it's just so frustrating). Not to mention that in my case it doesn't fit the screen, meaning I have to flip the laptop to use it as a tablet (To be fair I wonder if this issue is not related to flippable devices).

Garbage recent update made the app less responsive and the ui worse. Takes upwards of thirty seconds to load up when it used to take five.

I found it a bit of a battle to install. Once installed the UI is not at all intuitive, especially for someone not familiar with App installation.

Discord was fine before despite having a few visualisation problems and sometimes just not responding to the input, with this new update I honestly have to say that you did not improve anything, if anything you've worsened the navigation as the navigation before was (at least for me) more smooth. Edit: I got even more problems now as messages won't load sometimes (and no it's not my internet), starting up discord takes about 10 seconds or so and then everything loads in.	bug report

The new UI is utterly awful. It's so hard to navigate, and you can't even have an option to change back to the new UI. If all my friends still weren't on here, I would have uninstalled already. It's now incredibly hard just to look at what servers you're in, to just merely respond to messages, to even moderate in your own servers and set up commands. Looking up messages? Can't do that either, too difficult at this point.	feature request
I should have the option to remove my card information from my account, because I didn't sign up for autopay option. And I don't want money takin from my account without my permission. I have left messages regarding this practice. This is in violation of sales practices.

I should be reimbursed those funds or the data.	feature request

Well. As long as it's actually hiding my texts from people trying to spy on my info it gets 5 stars but kinda hard to prove	feature request
The updates being rolled out are actively making the app worse. It lags consistently, it will crash for no reason. Going off discord during a call disconnects you, some features are locked depending on what you use, and there are so many mobile bugs they refuse to fix. It's the only app that effectively lets me talk with my friends, otherwise it'd be 1 star.	bug report
this app has sent me into a downward spiral over the past 4 years	bug report

Normally this app works just fine with minor bugs, occasionally my texts will stop sending but that has become far less common, im leaving one star because my account has been completely banned for seemingly no reason, i submitted an appeal and am waiting to see what happens, i checked the terms of service and i have seen nothing i could have done to get banned, what is very frustrating is that it never tells you what you did to get banned, will change review if situation changes	bug report

nice app for convenience also since i don't have active service on my phone rn, nd with just wifi i can do everything on my phone i would need to do if i did had service which is a plus. but the constant interrupting ads and the fact this apps notifications dont seem to come thru on my phone n i did try to find a way in the settings to possibly change that so i get msg tone when i get a text or it ring when i recieve a call so idk.. hope the app can fix some bugs on it but its whatever haha	feature request

Seeing as it's been going on for years, I guess they never will.	bug report

great app! you can send people messenges and it is great and there are cool clips you can send and emojis. i did not like that you could not chat in the calls. i liked how you could make group chats with anyone who has Skype. but i did not like the ring tones at all. i reccomend Skype for anyone! i like skype more than other calling apps like zoom and the regular call app. i like Skype more because of the messenges you can send in skype! it is just like text but much better! you can even send clips from movies like despicable me 1, 2 and 3 and other cool movies and it has lots of super cute clips to send! But i just think that skype should make it so you could share your screen.	feature request

It'll freeze the video of the person I'm talking to every 30 seconds and I either have to minimize and reopen the video, which only lasts 30 seconds before it freezes again, or restart the app to get it work again. It's really frustrating since I'm on calls 24hrs a day. Other than that, the rest of the app works great. I just really hope they fix this bug. I've been paying for nitro for 2 yrs.	bug report
Have had this app for a couole months and i love it. Very easy to use, useful on ipads and tablets where you cant have your own number. Adds are annoying, but you get used to them. Great connection service for a free app. Calls just as good as on built in call apps on phones	irrelevant information

Discord was great for mobile in the past but its awful now with the new layout and added features that make the app more laggy, its debatable to keep using. I hope there is a second app made where its legacy and lite but I doubt it. Its sad to see it become more inaccessible. My advice to people who choose updates for Discord: Stop adding new features and updates. Focus more on fixing bug issues and lag, those are the real issue ruining it.	feature request

Like most folks who have offered negative or disappointing feedback in response to the app, I too have experienced a great deal of the problems expressed here, particularly with respect to dropped calls, missed incoming calls or calls that fail to notify or ring, and numerous drama involving the ads. Having said that, I've used the app for over 5 years as both a supplement to my regular service and occasionally even as a sole source of phone service when necessary. And I'm still here so...	bug report
Good but you have to pay $4.99 to get your verified like numbers to verify your things and I don't think that's there when you're the one who it says specifically free but it's not technically free cuz technically it's $4.99 and that's annoying when I'm trying to get my stuff so I can verify stuff and next thing I know it's time to have to pay for $4.99 for stuff I don't have time for that so that's the only battery I got and when and when it gets better then I'll have a nice review	bug report
Ever since the new update, when I open the app, im met with a blank screen or a previous conversation I was looking at that wasn't the latest session. Throw this in with long loading times and every discussion being listed as read only for 20-30 seconds has made this chat client incredibly frustrating to use.	bug report
It's like texting, but worse. Many technical errors, doesn't work well, don't download.	bug report

I think the app is pretty great, I had a few issues with it before but now they seem to be fixed, there are a few issues I still have now but can be mostly fixed with just paying monthly membership (I just don't have much money right now and can't really pay online at the moment) but I don't really have a real phone number so I think this is great if you need a backup or something along the line I do recommend („Éª‚àÄ„Éª)	feature request

I had a problem with one contact not receiving texts through Signal. I knew something was wrong, because messages would immediately check as sent, when other contacts have a delay while being sent. I tried uninstalling the app and installing again, but none of my texts were restored. Had to restore a backup. But my 1st problem persists. + Signal will no longer support SMS, it is not practical to use this app any longer.

Very difficult to make a video call and very very difficult to find the way to set favorites and there is no way to turn of the vibration for calls or video calls.

The previous  version was perfect i though that skype was a serious application. Before the updates it was a 5 stars application but now i give you only 2 and this just for the good history before, otherwise it was going to be only 1 star.  (Although the video call quality is good).	bug report
The recent changes to Onboarding completely restricting control of the Welcome Screen is a bad direction for the app. Onboarding requires you to basically complete a short quiz just to use the server. All of it's functionality is already done by bots and moderators in channels that restrict nothing, and the fact that they're trying to get it to replace the far simpler, quicker, and easier to use Welcome Screen is baffling.	feature request

New update has made the UI significantly harder to operate and less accessible. Things that took one tap or swipe are now multistep processes which causes me more arthritis pain and the colour saturation is causing me more migraines.

Signal works for secure communication, but it's been taking a bad direction recently. Once SMS is removed, it'll be nothing more than an app that could enable secure communication but won't have the userbase to support it. Good luck convincing friends and family to use two messaging apps. They've also added Stories for no good reason; using that developer effort to support SMS would be a better decision. Signal will just be a slightly more private WhatsApp without its userbase.	feature request

The latest update feels very unintuitive. One of the most incomprehensible changes is that if you're looking at pins or trying to search for an image, the results no longer show you images, forcing you to click on every possible post to find what you're looking for. That's not a cosmetic change to adapt to; that's just a blatantly worse function.	feature request
It has been good but I have not found a way to delete messages	feature request
Edit: fixed the issues I had by changing the wifi since it was smth connected to that for whatever reason, but sometimes (as in at least 25-35 times a day) when I open up discord it only shows me some channels in a server, makes images really big, and more. I have to close the app to fix the issue which after having done it so many times is ABSOLUTELY KILLING ME!

The texting part is a bit slow but works and the calling has horrible reception. Flashback to the old "can you hear me now?" commercials. In theory the app is good but it isn't quite there yet.

No longer useable, it keeps freezing.	bug report
Somehow a battery killer. I really want to give this 5 stars, because it's so easy to use and the setup was quick without any hassle.

Please revert to the old format, the new format is more time consuming, confusing, and just more uncomfortable to work with overall In addition, new bugs pop up everytime there is a change in layout or mechanics, making this much more annoying that it initially is	feature request
Very good quality, not able to do MMS messages	bug report
I've used this for quite a while now, and I am quite disappointed in what it has become. The new layout is extremely confusing for people who were used to the old layout. I don't like how laggy screenshare (on PC) is, as it becomes hard to see what the other person is doing. Calls are tedious to set up. Finally, I dislike how you've got to have Skype Credit to call abroad, when you can do it in other applications for free.  I would recommend using Discord instead, as it's really easy to join group chats or servers, talk through Direct Messages, call others and screenshare! It may be specified as for gamers, but anyone can use it anyway!	feature request

The app was not that great before, but the new version is in some ways worse. ***Not intuitive and not user friendly*** Why do some calls show up under Chats and others under Calls???

With the past two versions, I developed a peculiar challenge: Skype doesn't seem to recognize my Bluetooth microphones (tested with a Plantronics BackBeat FIT and with my car's hands-free system). It does eventually work--after uninstalling and reinstalling Skype. Pretty painful, if you ask me. [UPDATE 7/8/2019] After months of no Bluetooth issues, some are back. Specifically, in my car, I cannot use Skype via Bluetooth anymore. The app attempts a "media" connection as opposed to a "phone."	bug report

Hey discord, the app went from 4.6 stars to 3.3 in less than a month. Do you think that's good? I'm assuming you're trying to make the app more profitable with the latest update, and I get that, but you've obviously made some mistakes and instead of fixing them you are tripling down and not changing or fixing stuff you've OBVIOUSLY broken. Do you really think making the product harder to use and then ignoring a torent of negative feedback is going to net you more customers? Such an own-goal...	bug report

After the app was completely unuseable between version 126.21 and 206.16, the UI update made it run smoothly again and fixed the major alignment and navigation issues.

The new update has made it significantly slower to use and removed features. Now you have to use the filter menu instead of just typing them in, you can't directly switch between messages and servers without first clicking the button for them instead of just swiping (doesn't do anything now, wasted use of an easier action), it doesn't preserve where you were last looking as well in servers or messages, And I have no way of telling why it skips where it does in a channel.

And, file transfer size limit of atleast 1 GB.	feature request
Why does it say I have unread messages when I don't???	bug report
I love this app, but removing sms support is a deal breaker	feature request
Have used the app for years now, and the recent UI changes are probably the worst thing they've done to the app so far. It just isn't user friendly and way too cluttered.	feature request

Tried installing and running apps to earn minutes and never received them. Did that like 3 times and wasted 10 min could have just watched the videos n doubled that. Finally got enough min to make a call and they couldnt hear me. Whenever ive called my bf from a real # to his pinger theres been an insane echo and lag. I didnt pay my bill so my phone got shutoff this is my last resort. Sucks.	bug report

Really laggy and bad quality	bug report
I use Discord all the time, usually the desktop version. The new mobile update is the worst update I've personally experienced. It is just less functional than it was before. Searches were already bad on mobile, now you can't search an entire server, only each channel. I've canceled my Nitro because I simply refuse to support this garbage.	feature request
Really nice	irrelevant information

Wt , Signal. Dropping SMS support like this. Do you want people to not use your app?	bug report
Great App until you try to have two in the same room and it won't allow you to silence the audio output on either phone. This seems like a fairly essential fix given the number of complaints surrounding this issue. When it's just one device, this App provides everything I've needed.	bug report
Clunky UI, retrograde step from how mobile used to be. Random performance issues, it's almost like the developers don't want people using the mobile app.	feature request
As of late even after the most recent "update" I'm still getting random connecting at the top. Yes it's the current update but nonetheless very frustrating...having to close out the app and losing anything I started typing.	bug report
I don't know if my texts are going through, because I never get a reply. And you CANNOT make phone calls with this app. There is ALWAYS some "check network" B.S.  when I try to make a call. I won't buy an app if the free version doesn't work	bug report

It worked for the time being till I hed got a new number	bug report
I don't get notifications for some of the messages I receive. I have missed entire conversations from some of the groups I am a part of because the app does not let me know when they are happening. A couple of days later, the app goes back to normal, maybe for a day or two. And then it goes right back to malfunctioning. If I didn't have to use this for work I would have permanently uninstalled it a long time ago.	bug report
Im still waiting on my order or money back	irrelevant information

I love the app, but the translation part of the app doesn't work or maybe they need to have instructions on how to use it for dumbs that are slow like me. The instructions to me are not that clear. If someone could call me or if they had a contact number easily visible; I would give it a 5 star.	feature request
My phone hasn't worked right since I got text now I should have known 499 a year was too good to be true every time I leave my house in my Wi-Fi my mobile hotspot does not work I can't get a phone call when I leave the house I can't text I can't do nothing until I get back home now I'm going to get a new phone service text now ain't about nothing.	bug report

I have used this app since I got my first smartphone, for the security and privacy standards that were above the other options. Now they are throwing the baby out with the bathwater. I need one messaging app that will handle all my friends, family and business contacts in one place. They're making Signal useless now.	feature request

Sending of photos is very slow and time consuming, it's frustrating	bug report
The text part of it works perfectly fine but in order to have it function completely there's a subscription fee which is reasonable. But on the other hand it's kind of shady that they have a separate charge to remove the ads. When you pay for that premium service it's implied that you get premium and that there won't be other premium add-ons so. That's why I only get two stars it's unethical fix it.	feature request
This app is pretty easy and fun in usage but in the last update it have been really glitchy and i lost capability of pinging people while having photos in the message	bug report
This app used to work well before, the call quality was ok, the ads were reasonable, but now it doesn't work. The call quality is very poor and the audio is choppy, and the person I call cannot hear me. Also, when I hang up, it boots me out of the app and says that I am still on the line from the notification bar. Please fix this. Edit: Yes I am on the latest version.	bug report

I used to find this app useful but now the required updates are so ridiculously frequent that I miss more important phone calls than I recieve its beyond frustrating.

I love this app but it has one major issue that I don't like. It would be awesome if it had a delete feature. When starting new groups, it is usually the reason I opt for something different that allows deleting.	feature request

For years I have been using Signal with nothing but pleasure. It has occasional connection issues, but overall works pretty solid. To me it seems to be the best alternative to all those personal data greedy super powers. Until recently, where I was forced to switch to a new phone and phone number after my previous broke. Suddenly some of my contacts don't receive my messages or calls anymore. I reported this to Signal a while ago but did not receive any reply. I'm very disappointed after this	bug report

I am unable to open anything in discord. Every time I try, it closes the app. Very frustrating to say the least	bug report
Edit: Way to be cute and tell me to mention this on the forums you're ignoring Discord. I already did along with many, many others. Wow discord, wow. The new layout is clunky and now I can't even get to my settings without an app crash EVERY TIME. I get stuck in a server channel and even if I completely change which server I'm looking at it's still there. Channels open as read only immediately and stay that way for several seconds. Terrible, and I have nitro too, I paid for this garbage update.	bug report

Too bad! I can't down load new version to using in continue	bug report
new ui is awful and unintuitive, almost objectively worse than previous versions in my eyes. several bugs have been introduced over the past 2 years as discord adds more useless features and updates nitro rather than their actual app. one such bug involves the app failing to send me certain notifications, an absolutely critical feature of any texting app, occasionally just failing for no apparent reason	bug report
Fast and friendly	irrelevant information
Fun, fast and easy!	irrelevant information
Works but old..	irrelevant information
Honestly overall garbage app , I had the same phone number for 2 years nearly and had to lock in initatied that I paid monthly or yearly for , then they updated the app and made me have to pay weekly and I lost track just one extra day and lost my long time phone number, had to remove it from all my accounts etc left a couple that's not important , better off finding the newer apps that don't steal your number like that , either way good luck with your methods and godspeed y'all .	bug report
You pay for nitro so they can make Discord a better experience and they make swiping left reply to a message and hide the server members in the search button at the top right. It's unintuitive as opposed to what was perfectly intuitive considering on PC, server members are on the right of the chat window. So it makes sense that swiping left would show server members like swiping right shows your servers. It's an unnecessary and absolutely brainless change.	feature request
No U2F security dongle use. Not as secure as they say.	bug report

It works better than it did, but I can't play audio recordings. They are stuck downloading indefinitely. But on my computer they play instantly	bug report
Man, this new UI is incredibly bad. It's way too tap-centric with everything way too spread out across different menus. A longshot from the rather intuitive design it used to have. Now there's several buttons that don't work as expected. Most actions swiping left or right are completely gone in favor of buttons that are way slower and sometimes require twice as many taps. Honestly, if I need a manual to use the app, the UI designers failed their job. Btw, damn some of those UI elements are HUGE.	feature request
For some reason discord lags on my phone my phone is a Motorola but i don't know if it's the know brand or the phone but on any other device it works perfectly so 4 stars don't get a Motorola the brand lied and said their phones have the fastest speed but my phone kicked me out of discord 20 times this month. So 3 stars	bug report
Pretty good app, tho... there are a few problems, like one review said sometimes you can not exit out of a ad, and it has quite a few ads, so sometimes I have to wait like 30 secs for the ad to end.	bug report

This app charged my card and then Iit wasn't downloaded to my tablet so I will ask for a refund, it's a scam.	bug report
Its ALL ads! A block that takes up the bottom half of the screen plus ads in the text feed. You can see about 3-7 lines of actual text conversation. And the paid version is WAY too expensive for what it is. Might be worth it if the number wasn't blocked by most verification systems.	irrelevant information
Certainly the best	irrelevant information
Fine, however, I have a problem, the app won't send SMS messages, any time I try it is just stuck in a endless "sending..." loop, while my preinstalled messaging app works fine for sending SMS. Also, the new way how holding a message works is stupid af, can't say how many times I accidentally reacted with some stupid emote	bug report
I haven't been using this app very long, but so far it's been decent, except for some reason I can not hear the notifications whenever my boyfriend or anyone else messages me unless I've already got the app open & pulled up on my phone & actually looking at it though! I've double checked & ive got all my notifications turned on & volume turned up also, it's not a issue on my(phone's settings) end though! I'm not sure if anyone else has this prob or not!? Overall I'd say it's a good app though!	bug report

Ever since the UI overhaul, videos and gifs have been incredibly slow to load. On mobile data with good reception, it took over 2 minutes to fully load a 30 second video. It was genuinely faster to download the video to my phone and watch it there, which doesn't make much sense. That seems to be what was affected the most by the UI update, but the rest of the app is slower in general.	bug report
Great! But there is ads. There is a section to take off the ads for $4.99 a month or somewhere around that. But i would strongly recommend at least downsizing a little bit on the ads. Overall a great app!	feature request

I use this app just about daily to stay in contact with my friends, while stationed overseas, to play games. I recently upgraded (through Google Play) to a Nitro Yearly sub.

Signal is the best messaging app I have ever used. It is fast, secure, and easy to use. I love that it is open source and that it is not owned by a WhatsApp creator. Signal uses end-to-end encryption to protect all of your messages, so you can be sure that your privacy is protected. The app is also very user-friendly, with a clean and simple interface. Signal is a great messaging app for anyone who values their privacy and security. I highly recommend it to everyone.	irrelevant information

The problem is,  this version of the app doesn't have all the features my PC is expecting. I can live with that, but how the INSISTENCE on choosing a color. What if you don't prefer pastels? Or gradients? What's wrong with it plain solid color? And HAVING to go through the tutorials?  Practical matters,  such as, if I make a phone call,  NOT Skype to Skype, and I need them to call me back, what number do I leave? The answers are likely on the web site, but I'm not on the web site.

Removing support for send/receive SMS texts is forcing me to remove it as my default messaging app. Not all of my contacts use Signal, so while I'll be able to still chat with the 5 contacts I know who use it, I am forced to use yet another app to chat with friends.	feature request
It's cool and fantastic	irrelevant information
Bad UI design. Very slow conversation update.	bug report
Is great to communicate with friends, but the connection between my phone and the servers on the app is absolutely terrible. I have to shut the app down three times before it will load up properly. I'm sad this is one of the only ways to communicate between consoles. When it's working, it's great. The booting up needs some work.	bug report

Still my go-to app for gaming-related chatting, but the overhaul last month is terrible. The layout is clunky and everything takes longer to get to now. But worst of all, loading the app, entering a dm thread, or editing a message all take several seconds to load now. What used to be a speedy and streamlined experience is now just frustrating every time I use it. I really thought they would have rolled this back by now, at least until it was polished, but it's still just as poor to use as always	bug report
Features not working anymore I can no longer get the free. minutes for calls, I don't make many calls so watching a few video ads is a good way for me to get them, now I get booted out all the time, some ads do come up but then freeze till I'm again booted out, I am getting very frustrated with it	bug report
they fixed the gallery issue; now it crashes constantly. videos that are below the 8mb limit will often not send (for example, my video that was 1.3mb would not send and it told me to upgrade to nitro. im not because the app sucks). screen share audio messes up all the time.	bug report

Update broke the app. Picture messages have issues sending, app crashes randomly, search function is essentially useless now. No preview on pins and doesn't save your place on search/pins, you have to scroll through back through the whole thing, which is now one page instead of multiple. Desktop works fine, it's just the mobile app they broke.	bug report
Was pog up till this new UI update.	feature request
Extrodinarily buggy mobile app, much less stable than the desktop version. Video playback is abysmal, slow and finicky. The app sometimes gets stuck in landscape mode, causing visual bugs; channels being offset to the right too far, channel list being cut off prematurely, images being misaligned. More of a chore to use most the time. I suppose that's the average today, as people just accept the abysmal quality of mobile apps without criticism. Do better please, have more pride as a programmer.	bug report
It's still buggy but it's way better than Zoom	bug report

I've had this app for a long while now, and it's okay, but this new update is genuinely frustrating. Since I have an android phone, I can't send ANY image or video over 8MB now with this update. This seriously needs to be fixed ASAP.	feature request
There's two things I don't like about the app, you can't receive verification codes from other apps and you can't use you're number for other apps. Other than that it's an ok app	feature request
New GUI is much more difficult to use and unrefined. It feels like they're trying to fix something that was never broken. Gestures that previously worked no longer do, almost every button has moved, and many things are now hard to find, unintuitive, and unlabeled. It took me like 5 minutes to figure out where I could see the member list for a server, something that used to be accomplished with a simple swipe. Seems to be laggier as well..	feature request

Was great for many years, but sadly no longer. SMS removal is just idiotic. Uninstalling.	bug report
The PC/Laptop version of the app is obviously better than its mobile counterpart. I dont have problems in mobile except one thing, it's when everytime I send videos to a server/friend. Once it sends, it appears in a 1:1 size ratio even though the video is supposedly at 4:5 size ratio. This happens everytime, it sometimes does not even play. I have to restart the app to play the video normally. Still a great app! Though i miss the old username format :(	bug report

Please add support for foldables! Currently when we switch from internal/external display to the other one, app layout and image sizes in chat stay the same as the first display rather than the display you switch to.

Texting works near perfect, but calls not so much. Calls often don't go through, or randomly cut out. But by far the biggest issue is when calls come in, my phone simply doesn't ring, nor does a screen pop up telling me there's an incoming call. Yet, after I've "missed" the call, I get a notification informing me of the missed call. I've tried all sorts of different settings in an attempt to remedy it, and nothing works. So I basically can't receive calls.. BUT, for a free service, it's okay.	bug report

This app good for texting, but not good for a phone call, I paid 10 dll, but unable to pick up a phone call. Even sometimes after picking up, the quality so bad!	bug report
I used to love this app and would of given it a 4 or 5 star review before they discontinued the SMS feature, which used to make it an excellent all round messaging app. While signal messaging is secure, you can only use it if your contact has also signed up for the app. And most people haven't. So it's rendered fairly useless most of the time. I'll keep it for a little while longer for the whole 4 people I know that's stayed with Signal. Everyone else I know left when SMS stopped.	feature request
I like the new update and all, but the think I hate the most is that you can't add a channel to a certain category! Not to mention when you pull up Avatars for bots, the picture is made smaller. Please fix this Discord, I liked the app before this update!	feature request

I used to love Skype, but the Skype app in my phone rarely manage to notify me of new messages - and close to never within 0-5 minutes after receiving messages - nowadays.

My partner and I have been using skype 24/7 for the past 7+ months to communicate and we love it. The thing we most love about skype is the 'auto pick up' option. But there is so much room to develop the app. For starters, sometimes the notifications for messages, pictures fail to appear until you actually open the app, and the iOS my bf have doesnt have the auto pick up option even though its there on android and desktop application. It would be really awesome if skype team could fix these bugs	bug report
Eh. Normal Edit: Just use Discord. Skype has outlived its throne.	irrelevant information

Hi, I'm having an issue with the TextNow app. It's not allowing me to receive phone calls, only make phone calls. My phone will ring one to two times and then stop, leaving me unable to answer any calls. Texting is working, making calls is working, but receiving calls has not been working for the past four updates. Can you look into this?	bug report
I like aesthetic so I kept it in aesthetic	irrelevant information
I would give this app five stars, yet there are two small problems. One: I cannot use the letter "a". No matter how hard I try, I cannot use the letter a on this app and that is truly annoying. I can't use V either sometimes. Two: I can't text the person without hitting "edit contact" and then done first. For some reason, I have to do that to get to the texting screen. Please fix these problems and I will give five stars!	bug report
Don't like the way you don't have a vm # if you miss a call. I don't like getting emails that are hard to answer right away	feature request
New Ui is incredibly unintuitive, and a major downgrade from the previous version, which mirrored the desktop app in a satisfying and easy to use way	feature request
I hate the way this app works but I have to have it for work. It does a job ..... But it's not as good as email for large groups... And it's not as good as Facebook for small groups. So what's the point.	irrelevant information
they give you a number rhe take it back later a few days after activation, but even a week passes!	irrelevant information

Drops calls and calls are bad over half the time.	bug report
Senseless, poor experience afterall, uninstalled! Must be within 5 ft of modem to connect calls, & even then it cycles from Excellent to Good. At that point, my voice goes out & can't recover from error. My mom called me 7x today, just trying for adequate connection, dropped audio each time!! App won't allow you to close it after done, can't go back to Home screen after call, drops calls randomly call me back & phone won't ring. Sat here watching missed calls & VM left, but won't RING.	bug report
Good app but need to fix some issues. Doesn't allow me to answer calls and it's not allowing me to call out right now. Says something about using my data while roaming but I'm not even out of town PLEASE FIX!	bug report
It's fine and all but the major problem I have is the call feature because it's paired to my headphones but the audio is coming out of my phone not the other way around, and it this has been happening for months on end	bug report
I no longer receive push notifications when my friends message me. I have all the settings set up to receive them. Is this something that broke due to the latest update?	bug report
This app was great, until they COMPLETELY screwed it over with the new update. The new update is an eyesore, complicated to navigate for new users, and more often then not hella glitched out. The way they had before was perfectly fine, but the new update has just ruined it. For God's sake at least add an option where we can change it back to the old layout if we want.	feature request

Unfortunately it's probably the best privacy that we have. Samsung and Google keyboards still sell your typing anyway	irrelevant information
I've been using app since it was TextSecure in beta and now they've ruined the app removing unsecured sms capabilities. I want the freedom to send unsecured sms if wanted in a single app and they are taking that away. Expecting me to harass friends that don't care about their security in order to increase their user base is nothing but greed and unacceptable.	feature request
Edit 2022: Vastly improved, notice no difference between this app & fb messenger or Whatsapp stability. It keeps almost no data, highly recommend this app. It's a solid app to replace whatsapp when they share all your info with Facebook come February. Works very similar & has been fairly solid. I am using a OnePlus 7 pro product with no major issues. Edit 2023 Dec: Still great, now using a Nothing Phone 2. Best message app for security.	feature request
More secure way to communicate, all around the world. motivates me to at least want to stay in touch with people. ~ it would be nice if there was a way to know when a message sent, was delivered, and when it was read. That would be helpful. very	feature request
I like how the group messages can be utilized & split up	feature request
Takes lot of space and asks to download many apps. It is only time and mind consuming and we do not know how it works. Before experiencing the quality and ease with which we can utilise it, we are discouraged to go for it.	irrelevant information
How do I unupdate? I hate most about the new interface and features. Swipe to reply is just annoying and causes administration to needless take extra time. The new layout/design are dreadful and feel so corporate. having to go to another tab just to see DMs is cumbersome and having friend activity at the top makes is far too distracting for what is about messaging. The notifications tab, it hasn't changed much except you increased it's length. Only good is "me" because it is basically unchanged	feature request

Intermittent issues with messages never being delivered to recipients who aren't using Signal. Don't have issues with other mesaging apps so it's not a network/phone issue.	bug report

Getting better with the bugs, but there is now a new issue. My number is not working for my account now. It says it is in use, but it is not and I can't type in one of my servers because of it.

The new mobile ui sucks,it's laggy hard to use and all jumbled up honestly,discord became annoying to use for all mobile users and I feel their should be a option to change back to the old ui so it's optional to have this or that,the stupid functions with side screening n ect don't help. I'm pretty sure other people including myself have wanted this update to be fixed so honestly why not just listen to the users. Again at least add a button for the old ui so it's optional	feature request

Would like to say Thank You for all the different plan's. I never thought there would be a day that I could get free talk and text. I would have given 5 stars but when my 10 year old granddaughter uses my phone to call her parents and then asks why all these girls are asking to hook up and go on a date and so on, well thats not ok. I understand advertisements but thats something that could be avoided. Its bad enough seeing that stuff on regular TV but on here I just don't understand.	irrelevant information

Y'know if this app was just a massive battery drain while in voice chat(VC), I wouldn't mind it much and would have just dropped the star rating to 4. However, while in VC not only is it a massive battery drain, it also overheats the hell out my phone. It's actually uncomfortably hot every time I VC. Alongside that, the app will bug and display the contents of one server, or even a DM chat, inside another server on my end. There's so many bugs and performance issues.	bug report

With the removal of SMS I no longer have a reason to use Signal *exclusively* (keyword) which means I will not recommend it to friends and family in the future. I know SMS is not secure. I can't convince everyone in my contacts to switch. Bad move on Signal's part.	feature request
With the upcoming removal of sms/mms function app will become useless for majority of my contacts. I've been using signal for years and will be sad to have to stop using the app.	feature request
I love the app. I really do!! But if it gets to the point where switching from channel to channel freeze up my entire phone.. and it happens to a number of people... It would be best to fix it when you can. Yes it does it on multiple networks, but especially when I have my VPN on.	bug report
Does the job but the devs keep messing with the app and temp breaking it with every update. Also they keep removing the OLED dark theme which is very useful if you have light sensitivity and need things to be very dark in order to prevent headaches. Especially since their normal "dark" theme is not actually all that dark. It's more of a light charcoal grey colour really. If it's a matter of compatibility with the other versions of discord, create an Ultra Dark theme and then leave it alone.	feature request
i love it but the problem is it lags so often its annoying	bug report

I've been using signal for the better part of 5 years or so. While it's been great, the recent decision to remove sms support is something that will likely have me stop using this app. Sms support made it possible to have others get a decent enough private text app since it would perform double duty depending on what the recipient had as well.	feature request

However now I'm having a problem calling anybody in the evening time because it will deny me the ability to tell the person back that is the phone call from I would call anybody at all.

I use this app as my cell phone provider. For free service, it's a very good alternative to traditional cell phone service.

I highly recommend if your phone is compatible to use this as a primary/backup service provider for your phone.	irrelevant information
Very Good App. But my phone is overheat.	bug report
Says "The reason you are receiving this error and are unable to create a TextFree account is that our company experiences high levels of abuse during the creation of an account.

It's annoying that I need to install a rather large app to use it on a pc (no web interface) and that when I did so I couldn't access or migrate my data from my phone. I realise this is for security, but surely there would secure ways to do this (eg Bluetooth, USB cable, memory stick). I also can't see why the pc app needs to be so big for what it does.	feature request
Loved this app. But as of lately I cannot send text. I can call. Can receive calls. Can receive text. But I can't send anything. Makes no sense whatsoever. Tried contacting them but there isn't any way to. Also says it needs an update but when you click to go to it. There is nothing there. Just the open or uninstall button. Been using this app for over 5 years. And to be honest. Thinking about using another app. What's the point if I can't send text.	bug report
Don't like it. Like to be able to delete any or all messages permanently rite away.	feature request

Dude, the UI changes so frequently, and it's starting to get frustrating. There was nothing wrong with the old layout, and there should at least be an option to change it back if anyone decided to. Also, what's with the buggy notification system now? I'm not getting any alerts of messages sent. I've tried logging in and out, changing settings, even updating the app to be stuck with the new, horrible UI, just to try and fix things. Wasn't worth it because it didn't work.

Really like the app, great platform for creating and joining communities, and the desktop version is still 10/10 but this recent mobile update turned the app into some of the worst visual/UI design I've ever used.

Removing SMS support will end the networking effects this app had going for it. I care about encryption and privacy, but almost nobody else that I know does. I have been able to get people to switch to Signal because it does both. Without that convenience the uncaring majority won't be bothered to use the app anymore. End result: far fewer of my messages will be encrypted. Signal mission failed.	feature request

Very annoyed by the decision to remove SMS support. I won't be keeping two messaging apps, so will be uninstalling Signal. I'm also frustrated that the option to backup sms messages to export tona new default SMS app does not export my messages with other signal users, so now I lose those message histories when switching back to an SMS app. Bad experience all around.	feature request
Not a huge fan of the new UI changes. I dislike how I can't swipe left to see the member list for the channel and also, I dont much care for the new voice chat where it just shows avatars on the screen without even displaying standard call options and I can't figure out how to bring them up short of spamming taps til they open. Getting to where I can toggle each guys voice volume is a headache too. I miss the old UI. Id rate 1 star cause I'm salty but its still a great app so I can't.	feature request
please make it possible to get rid of sounds when u mute/unmute, join/leave channel, when using push to talk,... it's so very annoying!	feature request
Whenever I want to call outside the USA , then it pops up a message saying that calling the USA ? Invite them to download this app and then call ends if you click ok or if you do not click, nothing happens. Absolutely rubbish app . Frustrated	bug report
It was good. I was loving the ps5 integration but for some reason it's stopped working. My friend can't hear me and I've tried everything to make it work.	bug report
The recent UI update has brought many bugs like switching between chata can sometimes get stuck. A long time issue has been a person you've blocked or they to you still appears on the friend activity top of the screen and the only way to fix it is by friending that person again and unfriending them yourself.	bug report
Good messaging app. I hope the privacy policies will remain unchanged.	irrelevant information
Text notifications pop up with the text, but when you open the app its generally 2 to 3 hours before the persons message appears in your history. You can close and reopen the app, but its usually to to 3 hours before the text log updates. Also, EVERY site I tried for different things that has phone number verification will NOT allow a TEXTNOW number. It says the phone number is not supported	bug report
I am ashamed of this App no wonder Pinger does not claim it any longer. These people got greedy. Don't be a lazy money grabber, get up n out there!! The money will be there when it gets there.

Only about half of the people we added get the SMS messages, and the app itself doesn't give everyone notifications. I don't know what's up, but it is in dire need of some kind of software update because it picks and chooses some phones to work on and some not. The concept is nice, but the app itself is too problematic.	bug report

Finally got hit with the update, and it's every bit as bad as people say. Accessing DMs is a hassle, can no longer swipe to see server members, setting statuses is more annoying, every time I open a DM it opens waaay up the chain for some reason? Not to mention the app just constantly crashes and seems to be draining battery a lot more than before. Classic example of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Would literally give anything for this to be changed back. Won't be using as often. Horrible.	bug report
Dropping SMS support? I'll have to drop Signal. Can't tolerate multiple messaging apps.	feature request
I used this app a lot in the past, but no more as I have found TextNow superior in that it allows for free unlimited calling to any US/Canadian number.  This app has way more ads and annoying pop-ups and they make you watch video ads for 'mins' to make any calls (except to other textfree users.) That's my main issue with this app, it works fine for texts but calls drop often (normal due to latency and dropped packets.) I dont like that the app makes many background connections to servers while not in use.	bug report
Does not see my entire contact list. Why not?	bug report
This app sucks, all it does is keeps crashing over and over again every time I go to open the app.	bug report

I like the overall experience, I don't like that in settings you can't edit a contact. You have to delete them, then re-add. Annoying if you just misspelled their name etc. Also not liking that in settings you can't change/choose if recipients receive the "You will no longer receive messages from this group if you do not respond." They can leave the group if they want to, so not really not necessary. Some people just want the communication and not respond, where others want to respond.	feature request
Can't touch nothing or you'll tap an ad. Frustrating!	bug report
I cannot receive phone calls I have added a hundred minutes I currently have a 159 minutes I can call out just fine but I cannot seem to receive any phone calls	bug report
I like the basic function of the app: group communication outside of texting. However, there needs to be the ability to delete pictures, messages, as well as contacts. The permanancy of this app discourages more frequent and brosder use.	feature request
Horrible app. Calls won't go through. Moves slow. Crashes too much	bug report
I had this app awhile ago and decided to try it again. This app has really gone down. So disappointed	bug report
It won't let me open it up to use,	bug report
This was a great way to get people to think about encrypted messages. They have just removed sms support, this means that I have no ability to use it for talking to people outside of signal. The app is good, but it's now useless I'll have to be uninstalling it.	feature request
Usable. Only thing is when calling or receiving calls. Sounds far but otherwise works good	bug report
Why did you remove SMS support? The encryped messaging with other signal users is still great, but without SMS theres little reason to use this app over just pgp encrypting messages through sms.	feature request

Very good to used...	irrelevant information
Very good picture sound too.	irrelevant information
I would give it a higher rating except for the folloming issues: 1. When you open it it should default to contacts, NOT recent chats. Why should the app assume that I want to call someone I just talked to? Defeats the purpose of having a contacts list in the first place (which, btw took some effort to put together) 2. When I try to call a contact it offers every number I ever used for them including times when I misdialed, rather than what's actually stored in the contact.	feature request
Are you serious? Doesn't recognize my contact list. Zero stars.	bug report
It is cool when you do not have minutes...	irrelevant information

This app has never worked properly. It's the only app that does what it does, and is waaaay better than SMS groupchats (which is why I gave it two instead of one stars) but that's not a high bar. Crashes often, once it lost all my groups (still haven't gotten them all back), their support is absolutely non-existent and unhelpful. Also occasionally decided it doesn't want to send notifications or receive chats, and is nearly impossible to start a group chat on. Very bad app, only option though.	bug report
New UI is horrible and now clips off picture and video posts instead of resizing it to fit on the screen Search function is neutered and unintuitive Load times are much much worse	bug report

Very nice app. Calls are a hit and miss though.	bug report
The new mobile interface is unaccessible and unreliable. It made the previous intuitive layout more difficult to traverse and harder to understand. Discord may be a social app, but it isn't a social media. If they wanted the mobile experience to be better, they would've fixed the connectivity issues and server crashes (both of which were made worse by the update.).	bug report
Really nice social app to use, but as of now, there's some sort bug that doesn't allow me (and from what I've seen, my friends as well) to send images into chats. What's more, when you fail to upload those images, your gallery just doesn't show your pictures. Honestly, it's just an annoying bug since to reset it, I had to restart my phone countless times.	bug report
I prefer this to WhatsApp and pretty much all other messaging services. Good reliability, easy media transfers and they seem to take our data security seriously.	irrelevant information
Ever since the recent update, it's been running like garbage. Lags after every action, refusing to send pictures, sending pictures to a DM I'm not even looking at when it does. Even without the bugs, though, it just feels clunkier to get around the app compared to before. I wanted to give the update a fair shake, but so far it has just been an overall frustrating downgrade in my experience.	bug report
slow compared to others specially whatsapp	bug report
People were using bad words in the voice chat so please add this type of update that the voice call should be in recording mode you can delete that and you should have all the details so you can track their calls	feature request

It wont load anything like I have no internet but that is not the case. I tried switching wifis and data but nothing worked. It wont connect to anything on my phone.	bug report
Pro: - Free app that's great for communicating with friends; easily becomes an integral daily messaging solution Cons: - The development of the service unfortunately is becoming more subscription-centric, with many features paywalled and frequent reminders left and right that you're not a part of the club that can't be avoided - The terms of service also forbid modification of the Discord app or using alternatives, at risk of account termination	irrelevant information

Scrolling found gifs slows the entire app down. Video resolution is probably still 240p in 2021. And it will stay so in 2022. Also in 2021 resolution of sent images and videos is scaled down to very poor quality. And that also won't change in 2022.	bug report

Tried closing and opening the app tried uninstall and reinstalling with no success. Hasn't worked since 10/30/23, it just hangs at "connecting...". The application is up to date, I have full signal and connection is good. I even tried to uninstall and reinstall with no success. I just get a message saying cannot connect to Is server.	bug report
I like it when I can get on. Thank you & God Bless you!!!	irrelevant information
Used to be good but now the ads are so bad it can keep you from actually using the app.	bug report
Very difficult to navigate. Adding friends is gardz deleting them even harder. No thanks	bug report
I absolutely loved discord but after the most recent update I can't and don't use it at all anymore. I recieve no notifications from anyone, and the UI is insufferable to look at. I hope it changes back. No amount of free nitro or new additions is going to make me want to come back if the UI stays like this	feature request
it won't let me receive my messages! at all I dunno what's wrong with it but its not really working and can you guys please fix it this is important to me	bug report
The new layout is gross. Y'all made it so much harder to navigate, the only thing at all that I'd say is good is the swipe-to-reply function, but even then I would GLADLY trade that for the ability to swipe left to see the server members and stuff again. I wish you would have at least given us the option to keep the old layout. 0/10 please put it back.	feature request
annoying. I feel that the hungry, energetic company that started it all	irrelevant information
not bad but I sometimes dont get notifications and I either have to mute the whole chat or make sure I remembered to turn the notifs on. in addition, when I get messages, I will have read them, but it will still read as new messages and that I havent read them	bug report
Good app and all but my MMS won't come through	bug report

Constantly receiving Chinese spam messages even by following Microsoft's instructions to remove my profile from the search.

New UI is ugly and laggy, and I can no longer revert it.

Texting worked on my LG V30 but voice calls do not connect. Calling out I would hear one ring on my side then the call was immediately dropped. When getting a call in my phone would ring but when call was answered the call would drop immediately. On the phone making the call you can hear the ring but when call was answered it would just go back to a dial tone. Reading other reviews it sounds like textnow has been around for several years but it is still not ready for Prime Time. Free texting yes but the free calling part still needs work. Also I never thought they could put so many ads at once on such a little screen. Phone ran hot too.	bug report
Network problem only	irrelevant information

Phone calls through the app are rarely stable. Most the times the other party cannot hear me on inbound calls and it is half and half on outbound calls. This is while being on my home network which is a premium subscription with high throughput.	bug report
I see what happened to Whatsapp and see similar patterns with Signal. None of the developers respond to my messages. I posted a 5 star review when I first got this app. Now I am unsure about this, why is there no option anymore to change my safety number between other Signal users? That change as well as no longer supporting SMS seems very shady to me, and reminds me of the direction Whatsapp took before we discovered that it was no longer safe as well. Since Moxie stepped down, app has degraded	feature request

Becareful . I was told they do not sell anything. They are chat line only. It said I won a new phone just pay shipping. Said 2.99 for shipping charged my card 4.99 instead. A couple days later tried to charge my card 99.99 but I had called bank on 4.99 charge so they stopped the 99.99 be careful.

Great app if you pay the $5 to lock number and stop ads but it functions fine with free number it just shows ads after every call and sometimes text but with free number you can't receive verification codes	feature request
I am sorry but The experience only dipped after the recent update. The interface is so choppy. How Unfortunate that I was thinking it to be due to my phone until I can to report that I witnessed so many reports. Fix it ASAP. Or else I'll have to uninstall it. I am also a nitro member regularly so.... I guess you'll miss a loyal customer. Sorry.	bug report
This is by far the worst free texting and calling app it plays advertisements while your trying to make a phone call you can't hear anything but the add.	bug report

The new UI update completely ruined the apps functionality for me. The app is now much harder to navigate and barely functional.

App would be great if it actually notified me regularly when people post. I keep having to uninstall and reinstall it to receive notifications again. PLEASE FIX THIS.	bug report
Good app for communication. No bugs, limited features. Honestly, though, I only use it for one group of people, so while there are perks with the app, such as sending ability of GIFs, I would almost rather just go with using Groupme via text. It's good, you mainly just have to know the information for your people (phone #), and know who you want to talk to. Not amazing for finding people to talk to.	irrelevant information

Worked fine at first. The ads were annoying because the sound from them would go over the top of any other app even when the app wasn't being used (just open in the background). Then I didn't use it for a week. And they inactivated my number. The terms say 30 days for inactive. I have tried multiple times to get a new number. But still can't send any texts. So, it's useless. I was just using the free version to test it. But I certainly wouldn't pay for an app where the free version doesn't work.	bug report

good,. but devs need to make it retroactive in the sense that when a new contact is added to a group chat they are able to access all previous conversations hitherto. Or at least code admin options to allow permissions to unveil previous content.	feature request

I like this app and the service it provides with the exception that it makes my phone freeze up all the time. I had this app years ago, on another phone, and it did the same thing. The large, data-gulping ads that they run in the app overtax the phone's processor so much that it can't do anything else. Surely there must be a fine line between running ads and proper functionality? UPDATE AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE: So how exactly does someone take a "screen recording" within an app?	bug report

I used to use this app alot, and i liked it. Now, not so much. I wished there was a way to change your Skype name instead of it automatically being "live:[first part of your email]". I think there should be an option to change your name and not have an automatically generated one.	feature request

Currently the best chat app for gamers, but the new interface is complete trash and whoever designed it needs to be fired. If I wanted Facebook Messenger's interphase, I would have used Facebook Messenger. To add insult to injury, on top of looking horrible, the new interphase is constantly breaking, which causes the server list to not load and video calls now look like an extremly low quality crop job rather than a rescale.	feature request
This app is terrible, and I mean do mean terrible, about sending gifs. Half the time the videos fail to send too...even when it's under 30 seconds. Which by itself it also terrible..	bug report

Overall this app is amazing, I like the fact that you can have separate usernames due to the numbers but I give it 4 stars cause apparently y'all are changing that? Why?- ur just making it harder for ppl to find others- it's kinda stupid- also people can't figure out creative usernames Like others can, it'll end up ppl deleting the app most likely- The past few updates made the app a little more difficult üíÄ I can't even change my password if I end up forgetting it unless I log out-	feature request

There's a slight learning curve to building servers if that's what you're looking to do. But overall the experience is simple and easy, it is very user-friendly and a great app. They don't have ads at all (2023), and don't push you to pay to support the application. There's many amazing things that can be done within this app. The integration of bots and apps is amazing. Both voice and text chats are well made.	irrelevant information

Turns out I had sound all the way down, sorry! I think I found a new bug though; it might be because I have it so my pc receives audio, but whenever I open a voice chat it prevents any and all audio connection over bluetooth. RE: I'm using bluetooth to connect with my pc, not wifi or mobile data. Entering a voice chat on mobile is keeping any audio from playing on my pc via bluetooth. I believe it might be the same with headphones that connect the same way.	bug report

I don't know why there are so many negative reviews for this most recent update. I actually like how everything is more organized now. I'm not experiencing any glitches as opposed to the other reviews. Those who are saying it's counter-intuitive are just not used to change because using discord for the first time was always confusing no matter the person.

The recent changes to Discord (12/23) make it a really good masterclass on how to destroy de goodwill of your company by forcing a big update that changed the user experience into an unrecognizable mess. The menus don't work as the user expects, the conversations are hidden from where the user found them before, and the overall redesign makes this basically a different app.	feature request
Hi, I am not getting notifications when my phone is on battery saver mode. All the other messaging apps work fine, but not Signal. Having difficulty to communicate.	bug report
New UI makes for a hilariously bad mobile experience. I will be downgrading and never using this awful UI, especially considering Discord clearly doesn't care about its users feedback.	feature request
Discord used to be fairly reliable, would've given 4-5 stars before. However they updated it recently and the new UI is dire, making many features just harder or less convenient to use for no real reason? :/	feature request
The new UI update is ghastly and not *intuitive* at all. Swiping no longer pulls out the sidebar, but instead sets up a reply to whatever message you happen to swipe over. Looking around reveals no *intuitive* way to access the sidebar. Having seen replies to other feedback, I have to stress that long time users should not need a *tutorial* in order to use the app. The point of UI is to function intuitively, and be easy to access. This is not it. Nitro cancelled & uninstalling until fixed.	bug report

Great app 4 messaging, voice & video calls. Does group calls/video calls & messaging well & the ability 2 call landlines & cellphones @ low rates is very nice. There r a few problems though - the app sometimes fails 2 extract phone numbers from your mobile's phone book resulting in you not being able 2 make calls 2 cell numbers & landlines. Unfortunately, the user interface is crappy. A number of important options during a call r hidden, e.g. adding people, earpiece to bluetooth switching.	bug report

If I could tell you the number of times I've sent a message, only for the message to disappear and not appear sent for a day, or the amount of times I have message delivery failures I'd be here all day. Also you can't copy and paste failed to send messages. So you either have to pray it goes through or type it all again. Or be big brained and screenshot the failed text and send it as a picture.	bug report
It wont let me send pictures but other than that it does the job .	bug report
Can't login. Asked to verify over & over because "we believe you're using automated tools to browse the site". The only automated tools I'm aware of is google who will disable certain permissions due to security concerns.	bug report
Works for groups of people who only text	irrelevant information
I'm grateful that the app does work. The only thing not working for me is volume issues, there's no way to adjust them. When I make a phone call I can barely hear the other person and they have trouble hearing me. Also I customized the notification and ringtones. But whenever someone texts or calls no sound at all is made. It wasn't doing it before I customized too. I have to keep checking my phone for texts or calls. I was hoping maybe technical support can help me with this please? Thank you.	bug report
Using this app on the Pixel 2 phone it hides the number you're dialling. This means you don't know if you dialled the right number.	bug report
Love this app but I don't like how it keeps being laggy in vc when screen sharing. I've tried doing many things, updating it and stuff like that but it just doesn't seem to work. I was also told it keeps cutting out my voice along with others when speaking. If there is a bug for this please try to fix it.	bug report
The video quality is great but the messaging is glitching out and sometimes doesn't send what is written. It's frustrating!	bug report

Stop trying to make discord like other social media platforms. It was fine before. But you went and made it worse. Now it's a pain to navigate between my servers and DMs. What was once a single press is several. I want to check who's online. Swipe left. Oops that's reply now. So long years of muscle memory. Now we have to stretch all the way to the top of the phone. What's that in my DMs? Some story type garbage scroller at the top of my screen that no one wants or asked for? Stop it, get help.	feature request

New changes to the UI make it impossible for me to read and access, it's glitchy and will sometimes send messages to other people instead of the ones I CLICKED ON. They won't let you go back to the old UI. And honestly it's been a downgrade. They also disabled YouTube comments because everyone hates this forced change but they are going to force us to get used to it, because screw us, the customers. :)	bug report

I have used Discord for some time now and I very much enjoy it. Unfortunately the refund policy is shameful, and I'm going into possible debt for it. I received the option for a free trial of Nitro, but afterwards I was charged to continue it and not notified. I contacted support, and was only told that unfortunately they cannot refund "my" purchase because I redeemed codes within 5 days of the it. I was unaware that they'd even charged me for Nitro at the time. Would've given five stars.	bug report
The app doesn't not work at all It's keeps asking if am human and doesn't verify the phone number it's annoying	bug report

I like this app with being able to talk to someone without having to worry about people being able to hack into our conversations and know what myself and someone else are talking about. For just ONCE, I like to know that my privacy is being respected! However, unlike when I was on WhatsApp, I can't tell when my other party is online until they message me.

It's not bad, but it needs more functions if it's going to be as simple as a messaging app	feature request
It's a very good message app EXCEPT some folks have the app but don't use it. Since Signal knows they have the app, it automatically sends my texts to the app and not to SMS. And thus my texts are lost. This despite their sending me SMS without Signal. That sucks and so it must be 3 stars	feature request

I use Discord daily and after the most recent update it is horrible. Way harder to navigate given you have to tap multiple times to get to where you want to go and loading is slow. The old UI was far superior where you could see everything at once versus a small amount of friends or servers at a time. It was also better in appearance imo, don't like the bubbly look. Please give us back the previous UI cause this one is frustrating, not user friendly and slower.	feature request

The new layout is a hard downgrade from the old interface in terms of usability and ease of navigation, and that's if you don't even encounter issues regarding loading or sending messages. I don't get how this app went from running buttery smooth with a native Android app, to React Native which was somewhat smooth on my device, could get unacceptably slow and buggy. I've used the platform for years, and it really seems like they want to kill and milk the platform for its worth.	bug report

I use discord all the time! Any app that pops up a full-screen "GIVE US A RATING" bubble gets an automatic low score, however. Want a rating? Here's your rating. There's also the fact that when app behavior is changed, there's often no way to revert to the prior functionality, such as the recent-ish change where swipe left replied to a message. This would have been fine if it was an option... but it forced the behavior with no way to use the old behavior of opening the right side panel.	bug report

Good app It's great for college groups. Easy to use and i enjoy having multiple group on here rather than Messenger or text groups.	irrelevant information
lots of distortion and bad connections with calls. Makes it frustrating to try to use often when talking overseas.	bug report
Liked this group messaging app up until the latest update. Now you dang thing won't login via Microsoft, Facebook, Google, or email. If you have a Motorola Z Force droid edition this app isn't going to work.	bug report

Your UI is bugged.	bug report
Works all well, thank you for the help on fixing my issue	irrelevant information

It is one of my favorites in my opinion, discord let's you talk to people and help make fake friends ‚ò†Ô∏è and it let's you troll as a anime girl‚ò†Ô∏è just kidding it is just a fun talking app that lets you FaceTime and make online friends	irrelevant information
I've used this app on and off over the past few years due to financial necessity, and although its free, its by far the most painfully agonizing experience I've ever had with a phone service my entire life. I can't answer calls, I don't receive texts on time, it doesn't alert me when I have a text, it takes 20 minutes just to type the first word of a text... its frustrating. I feel bad complaining about something free, but enough is enough!	bug report
Horrible app , deletes ur number after 2 days of not using it. Incoming calls don't notify you . And now losing my old number from this app says there is no new numbers to use	bug report

Texts work when u have a signal. calls don't regardless of having a strong signal or not	bug report
Love this app so very much but would like it if Discord would fix the messages coming in delayed and resending it again, and if it'd let me reinstall it on my phone. My discord nitro is still on it so yeah I'd like to reinstall. I restarted my phone, factory reset my phone, undid the battery on my phone went to my data to download discord still wouldn't work.	bug report

I love Discord. But Discord mobile's new UI? Not so much love. Feels like a knockoff FB Messenger. Colour doesn't match desktop Discord anymore. Worst of all is the search function and pins. Previously, it was easy to see who sent the messages in the search results or who was the sender of the pinned message because the avatar distinguished it. Now it doesn't. It's impossible to tell who sent the message at one glance. Please listen to your users and revert some of the changes.	feature request
Pretty good üëç, you have to add contacts which is very hard to do. That is my ONLY complaint.	feature request
Why is one of my friend always online while she is not online??? How can i fix this problem on this app??	bug report
Every time I go to call my daughter it sounds like a really bad connection and we can't understand each other.	bug report
Needs improvements and widgets for dialing phone number from subscription.	feature request
The app is good all around, my only issue with it is Nitro membership, you all have basically locked free features behind a paywall, noone should have to pay $10/month simply for a banner, which, every other website/app that offers profile customization has this for free. Not sure who thought this was a good idea but they should be fired. At the very least make the customization free and replace it with a different paid feature. Something original.	feature request

*edit, one year later... A banner ad just yelled at me about bacon... If I hear that again, we're definitely going to break up (me and text now). I pay some money. Banners are fine. Please, no sound. First year impression: It's a great deal. I paid to have the ads reduced to banner ads. I mostly use it because there's no cell service where I live, but there is wifi. And it allows me to text people from home.	bug report
There are some glitches	bug report
I have a major problem with this app. And my problem is that it's not letting me send or receive text messages. I have already went to support and read the articles telling me to make sure the app isn't down and to make sure it's updated which I did both of those things , and it still didn't work so , and so i went to contact you guys and it said to click on the support bot and wait for the get in touch to come up and it didn't .	bug report

I've been a loyal user of Discord for quite some time, but the recent UI changes have left me feeling frustrated and disappointed. The decision to revamp the interface has resulted in a user experience that feels clunky and less intuitive. The new UI design seems to prioritize aesthetics over functionality, making it harder to navigate and find essential features. The changes to the layout and organization have disrupted the familiar flow and ruined the UI. I would like for a change back.	feature request
Excellent app, but lags a lot since an update a few weeks ago. I'll update my review of the lag issue is fixed!	bug report
It's an awesome app. We just need to be able to use one account on multiple devices.	feature request
The worst app ever... It's so lagging opening or sending messages even if I have a good internet connection. Hopefully you'll improve.	bug report
The app has much improved this past year.	irrelevant information
Not sure what's going on. Ill use the app and it'll work perfectly fine for a while and then it'll black out. Not sure what's up but its very annoying and makes it almost impossible to use the app. I'll rate it 5 stars if this gets fixed somehow! The black outs are just super annoying	bug report
I no longer update this app due to the fact that the developer NEVER tells exactly what has allegedly been updated. The ONLY reason I continue to keep it is because I've had the same number for over 3 years.	irrelevant information
Switched to Whatsapp! Can see what people send me on the main menu screen but when I open the individual chat their messages don't appear. It will automatically scroll up the chat to a prior days chat. I don't receive messages until 20+ minutes after they are sent by the other person. Very inconsistent. Not receiving notifications regularly either. Sometimes do and sometimes don't! No search feature. Looking to use a different app moving forward.	bug report
All my messages are failing to send since the update	bug report
The app is good but the verification required keeps popping up when nothing is wrong with my account	bug report
I absolutely hate the new update. The UI is terrible to navigate and incredibly buggy. The search function is way worse than it was before. Some things require several steps more to reach than it did before.	bug report

Second instance of SKYPE is no longer working after today update on my Samsung S21+ running on Android 11.	bug report
The only reason I have not made this a 1 star review is because I've been with this app since 2017 and do like the app. The UI update feels it feel unorganized and unoptimized for your 'gamer' users. Having to go through two menus to get to your friends list is impractical, not to mention the fact that members of a server are on another tab now and not easier to access to see who is online. Look discord, you're great but listen to the people who ACTUALLY use your app.	feature request

Too difficult to use and no local phone numbers. Too many ads.	feature request
The new ui update ruined the app. It takes much longer to see who's online, and I can't just peek the user tab while also seeing if someone srnds a new message. Bring back the swipe right to see who's online tab. It was a realy nice feature, and removig it made the user experience much worse.	feature request

App let some old trash accounts and crooks hiding behind them illegally connect with mine despite me blocking off the addition of any form of contacts to my acct. I logged in one week and the next some old junk contacts long removed got attached. That's a hate crime and identity by the crooks behind this massive breach that started in 1998. Microsoft fought this mess for years; took measures at the turn of the century with other mega tech companies to block computer dooms day - but not now.	bug report

Messages are easily missed compared to regular texts. I use it to keep all communication as a group leader in one place, but I wish on Android there were a counter on the icon corner notifying me of unread msgs. The app is also buggy. I've set it to send SMS msg so I don't miss posts bc of the above issue, and some come through while others don't. D on't get me started about the sheer redundancy in downloading a texting app but setting it up to send me a text, too. I've also received spam.	bug report

TextNow used to be a decent way to save on Cellular costs. But their Paid Plans are no longer the cheapest. And before you could call customer service, then it changed to only email, and now only text. The Free version with Ads used to be good, now the Ads are intrusive because they pop-up and freeze your screen, even when you didn't click on it. It's definitely NOT recommended. They now find devious ways to get you to pay, like you no longer can get Verification Codes under Free plan.	bug report

Unoptimized for the fold in general. Am using the Fold 5 and it screws up anytime I switch from folded to open mode or vice versa depending on what mode I opened discord in the first time. Work around is turning on auto rotate and going to landscape mode to portrait mode or restarting the app. Edit: there was an update to the app since last review. Tried updating and reinstalling. Also went on the link provided in the reply to the review, but still having same issue after trying the fixes.	bug report

It's also annoying that when you run out of mobile data, it's gotta notify you every time you open the app that you're out of data, and it give you a notification that doesn't go away saying that you're out of data as well.

Great for a free app. Wish it allowed for better control over events. Have to scroll through messages to find events. Would be nice if events could be linked to popular calendar apps e.g Gmail Calendar	feature request
An amazing way of keeping in touch with family, friends, and loved ones üòÅ!	irrelevant information
Newest update (as of 12/12/23) is SO incredibly buggy. I can't properly go between chats or pictures without needing to full close and restart the app. Conversations from one server chat display no matter where else I click. Genuinely tired of it.	bug report
As of the recent UI update my rating of this app has lowered substantially. Why change what was already perfect, and why on earth would they add an auto rotate feature that you can't turn off, doesn't matter that my rotation is locked everywhere else on my phone discord decides to bypass that. Discord should have a legacy mode or something where you can opt into what UI version you want because this is just terrible. Not a single person I've spoken to about this update likes the change.	feature request
It doesn't always open notifications properly have to close app and reopen.	bug report
the notifications are taking up too much space on My phone screen, would be nice if they would group together to save space.	feature request
The new update have improvements and i happy the update but there's Minus. The minus i can't finished the roles and can get out when it's done. Can development of discord fix this bug because it's annoying for people who got same experience. Also, the update now was have more bugs than improvement. So, please look it up as possible.	bug report
Its actually a good and perfect app 100%intelligence i really love the app	irrelevant information
Great messenger app till sms support was removed. Still use it with my tech and privacy savvy friends and it works well, but difficult to convince non-tech savvy people to use 2 separate messaging apps despite the privacy advantages of signal. Was much easier when they could just have the 1 app installed and I wish that the devs kept that functionality.	feature request
It's a great app most of the time. However sometimes it takes a really long time to send the message you just typed.	bug report
I dont really like this app i actually just looking for a app that let me text and call with my phone number cause my phone fell in water and my mom didnt let me put in rice cause she saids a waste of food so this give you a number but does not let you use your own phone number but be side that it is pretty good on everything else	feature request

SMS support was removed without notifying the users. Worst of all, the settings and menus stay the same, so I thought something was wrong with my phone or SMS counerparty. I feel like dumping Signal and using Telegram. One less messenger to use in my phone.	bug report

Oct 25: trying to transfer data to new phone, half way through the transfer (100+k transfers) just gets stuck and I have to start all over. I'm lowering the rating for this inconvenience.

Why a pin was implented is beyond me. It's annoying having to verify it and being forced to set one. I don't mind losing my logs and I prefer you not to store them. Seems like it defeats the purpose of private when I don't know who you're letting see it. Now, I get notified of calls and messages long after they were received. If someone calls, I'm looking at my phone and it never rings. I wish this worked.	bug report
I had a VERY difficult time getting logged in initially! The sign up failed. And, trying to reset the password failed also. Their Tech Support kept sending me back to the same online password reset page despite WEEKS of back-and-forth emails telling them that method wasn't working for me. Finally, a tech manually reset my password as I asked from the outset. And, once they did this, its worked fine.	bug report
It's slow and it sucks	bug report
The share link doesn't work on mobile. When I send a share link, my invitees keep getting a blank grey screen and they can't join the group. I've sent 3 emails to support and no response. The link works fine on desktop. It looks like it's not working on Android. When I sent the share link to someone with an iPhone it worked. When I sent it to someone with an Android, they got a grey screen.	bug report
Does not work unless I have very good internet access but twice I'd great	bug report
Now my profile that I made after the mistake got banned on a server for no reason the logs don't show I was banned	bug report
The app has gotten better. I'd recommend it to people who don't need unlimited calls and texts, only a few texts and calls. This works really good as a 'free' alternative.	irrelevant information
Use this app daily and talk to my buddies. New update makes mobile discord a headache and annoying to use. I don't see what the point of changing it was considering it was already simple. Sadly probably gonna use the app less.	feature request
Groupme works very well enjoy using it, it is easy and you can communicate with multiple people at once. I would highly recommend this app.	irrelevant information
Works fine enough. Would like better if things were deleted instead of hidden.	feature request
The new UI is awful. They took everything you're familiar with from PC and threw it in the trash to make it look more like Messenger, and it somehow ended up worse than that pile of trash. Please revert the changes, I am literally begging you. The old app was a strong 4, maybe even a 5. This new one is borderline unusable. Navigating it is confusing and unintuitive.	feature request
Discord calls don't work when my phone goes on rest mode	bug report
Still disappointed Signal hasn't backed down on their decision to stop supporting SMS. It was a great unified communication app for years, but I doubt I'll keep it when I can only use it to talk to the few other signal users in my contacts.	irrelevant information

new mobile layout feels clunky and tedious, can we opt out?	feature request
When you have a question and it's not on any of your answers you can't get any back. If you had someone that you could communicate with besides reading information cause My question is not on there. I need! help actually I should give you one because you don't have anyone to talk to. I can't find any number whatsoeve. Every time I dial my phone number from another phone it says it's disconnected. so I don't know really what is my phone number.	bug report
Tldr, updates still got issues as of jan 20th 2024 The new discord mobile is a hot mess, where it used to be able to easily go between servers and chat you cant any longer. I preferred the old setup as it was both easier and faster to use I am updating this again for the second time just to show that while its been updated the issues have not been fixed. They should revert to the old setup as it was better.	bug report
The latest update for the Discord mobile app really does not lend to accessibility and intuitive user experience. In fact, it takes more taps/gestures to access both DMs and servers. The new dark mode is also too dark, and causes eye straing with prolonged use of reading the high contrast text. I hope the team opens up the option to revert to the previous version, for users who prefer that layout more. As the old addage goes, don't fix what isn't broken.	feature request
The worst, probably who owns it.	irrelevant information
Too easy to pocket dial.	bug report
I actually used to dislike it and refuse to use it unless absolutely necessary. It has improved tremendously since and it became my default app to communicate with everyone.

Genuinely loving this game. The recent change to progression though feels pretty bad. I was a big fan of grinding the different characters to unlock everything - Detaching class progression from playing the individual classes completely erased the incentive to play the different classes. Now it's more efficient to just grind one class for whom you've unlocked your "perfect" deck, and use the rewards to unlock the rest. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.	feature request

I'll leave my original review below. 1 star as they're removing the best feature. I doubt the platform will survive without SMS: Wow this the best messaging app by far. It's great to have private messages / group messages and all my SMS in one place. It's fully featured too. If only people would ditch WhatsApp so I wouldn't have to juggle two apps (also WhatsApp lacking true security+ owned by Facebook üôÑ)	feature request

The only reason I am giving it this rating is because I have tried to cancel my subscription, but it won't let me. I have sent multiple emails in regards to this and when I recieved a response they sent me to the link that didn't help, and after explaing that no response. I never had a problem with this app I liked it a lot but trying to cancel and get a response is the part I am very fustrated about. I don't want to pay anymore money.	bug report

Ever since the UI update, the app has gotten a lot harder to navigate and use casually. The biggest problem is quality of life features getting worse after this update. For example, pinned messages in DM's no longer showing who sent the message and images there no longer being embeded, servers and DM's being entirely seperate tabs and therefore harder to keep an eye on and many more. I use the Discord app frequently and think it's overall great, but with every update it just seems to get worse.	feature request

Originally dropped from 5 to 4. Now from 4 to 3, and I've canceled my subscription.

I can't use the app it kicks me out right away I tried restarting my phone ten times looking at YouTube videos and nothing worked I tried re installing and un installing and I tried doing this on my other phone and it's the same problem I tried TextNow and it's works way better please fix this	bug report
Images/gifs are horrendously cropped and compressed (I have full nitro, it shouldn't be compressed!), editing channels, viewing profiles or editing messages are scaled down to a window so tiny you can't even see what your clicking on or reading channels disappear halfway while scrolling. I could keep listing problems but I'm hitting the character limit. It's unusable. Edit: 5 Months later and this is still a bug, though restarting fixes it now, It shouldn't be a bug when it's been 5 months.	bug report

After an entire week they finally re enabled my wife's account. I've been using discord for so long and I love it but dealing with the trust and safety team has left me completely disappointed. The response time was terrible, the responses were terrible and I don't feel safe or trust the team to act justly swiftly. It really sucked to go through this especially after spending $150 on nitro and boosts. Discord don't even bother disabling underage accounts if you can't respond appropriately	bug report
The recent UI update is horrible. The general theme is awful, and the right side bar is GONE. Please revert!	feature request

One of the best Video calling app. I love the recording feature. But need some improvements. 1. Easy downloading photos, videos, docs etc (Select all, select manually, select all audio, select all video by date or time). 2.Download manager (To see download progress). 3. Recording conversation in both full screen (not cropped). 4. 5mins (atleast) video file sending limit. Thanks Skype. Keep doing a great job.	feature request
this app works well when I need to give out my number and don't want to give up my privacy. I like it a lot.	irrelevant information
Horrible new UI update makes the app extremely laggy, unintuitive to use and FULL of bugs. Switching from DMs to Servers takes forever, and the pages themselves take up so much unnecessary space.	bug report

Was a great app, had no complaints. Unfortunately the new layout is unintuitive and generally less efficient than the previous one. You can change it back in the settings for now, but I've heard they'll remove that next year. It's definitely a strange decision to push this.	feature request
Pretty solid overall and great privacy peace of mind. Bit of feedback it needs to do better and handling large video files instead of just saying it's too big. The quality recorded by new phones at 4k 60 means the large filesizes. Apps like Whatsapp actually compress the video and send it.	feature request

Honestly, for Many Years it was really good until the recent update. It's trash, the navigation. Also to check who is online and who isn't. Plus, it's glitchy now. It was a useless update. They were trying to fix something which needed no fixing. Mark my words they'll now use this to promote nitro. Discord Should revert back to previous settings. The Ratings also took a massive hit, look how they're at 3.4 rn	bug report

For texting this is one of the best apps for mobile, but the amazing audio for PC simply does not apply for mobile, making this one of the worst ways to call someone on your phone. The audio quality on mobile for yourself, other users, and streams is just so horrible that a lot of the time you will simply be unable to understand the other people that are talking and quiet parts of streams aren't able to be heard at all. I absolutely love discord, my #1 messaging service, but don't VC on mobile.	bug report

Latest update is horrible in a long line of updates that have made this app worse.

New UI is a joke. It's now less intuitive, features are hidden behind more clicks for absolutely no reason, and the layout is a mess, with items moved from always being stacked to the top-left allign down, now to absolutely everywhere on the screen, while having longer animations making navigation a absolute pain.

good app, but there are SOOOOOOOOOO many bugs its really annoying	bug report
When I'm trying to clear my call log, a lot of the numbers can't be deleted.... why??	bug report
I like the app for communication within a large group. It avoids keeping multiple text chats going. I appreciate the ability to love a comment and mute or leave the group when desired. I would prefer to be able to completely delete conversations, but that is not possible; I'd like to see that in an update.	feature request
Safe and secure messaging app, very good.	irrelevant information
I've used this app for almost 8 years and it's been great. However now that they're dropping support for SMS/MMS messages, I'm uninstalling the app and will use Google messages. Too impractical to use two different messaging apps... Seems like a horrible mistake for Signal, my family only installed it for me so they'll obviously be uninstalling it as well. They're far less tech savvy to even consider dealing with two apps.	feature request
Very bad app after the last update I can't even open or reply to messages very awful	bug report

Works great! No issues. Best for texting friends in other countries.	irrelevant information
good for texting not so good for calls	bug report
The app is completely broken and doesn't work at all anymore, can you explain to me how the last update was actually an update and not a downdate	bug report
Everytime I open it, there's an update which take a minimum of 15-20 minutes resulting in time wastage and defeating the purpose of watching something together based on a fixed schedule. Everyone is not always available to sit around for these updates so it would be better if we get an option when to update instead of forcing the update on us randomly!!!	bug report
I'm trying to use My phone rigut now	irrelevant information
It was great at first! But now ill get notifications of new texts, but when i go to open the app the messages are no longer there! This has happened to the last 3 or 4 texts. Its very upsetting knowing i have important messages that i can not see! Hopefully its fixed soon.	bug report

Breakin the law! Breakin the law! Are lyrics to a song.	irrelevant information
I can't genuinely express how much I hate the update. Your app from being fair and good performance now to worst. Switching servers and channels gotten slow with delay and even bugged. Even sending messages frequently fail only to be resent the next time I open the app, finding out I just replied now. I don't see why the change unless you're getting rid of mobile users to save your server storage by making your app worst. Please do fix it and address with honesty with users. Do not ruin further.	bug report

Very hard to use with Midjourney from the newest update.

Hello! I just noticed that I'm experiencing a weird bug when it comes to sending images. I'm not sure if anyone else is experiencing this, but it keeps saying "error to send message" when I try to send images through certain chats.

The Old original version was so much better before Microsoft got their hands on it and ruined it, I have used Skype for years but now it takes so long to boot up on phone, it's so annoying, you can't see who is online anymore and the whole layout is rubbish, I don't receive any notification on my phone so I never know if I have messages. My desktop version is so much better but the original was always the best before Microsoft!	bug report
So, I've been using Discord for a few years now and it's experience has been decent Now, with what I believe is the latest update, I have ceased updating the app. After talking with multiple people, the general consensus is that the UI changes should be reverted. I realize that the number is not necessarily indicitive of the whole population of Discord's users, but I do ask that it be taken into account that, out of approximately 30 people, over 20 said to revert the mobile UI changes.	feature request

I used to love Discord. It was an amazing messaging app, easy to use, but ever since the new update, I just hate using it because of the layout. Maybe if there was a way we could switch between the old layout and the new one, that would be amazing and I would raise my rating.	feature request

Looks/feels like Signal is under new ownership or management. Too many changes in rapid succession to keep up with. Went back to stock Messages several weeks ago. I get need or desire for growth, so no hard feelings, just not for me anymore. Don't do a ton of texting, but it's comforting to know that my conversations with my wife are secure from prying eyes.

The new UI has done nothing but slow down the discord experience. I shouldn't have to restart my app every single time I want to see my servers or swap to a new channel. This is not a problem with my phone, as it had not occurred before the layout update and it isn't just affecting me.	bug report
It won't let me register my number. It keeps telling me that I've attempted to register the number. It says try again later but it doesn't say how much time later. I've been waiting for a whole day!	bug report

Only thing is navigating from past call list to dial pad, seem a bit awkward. Also when phone is moved the page has a bit of lag to reorient. Makes it slow to disconnect. That said, very convenient to be able to call over WiFi with my phone with out a cell signal.	feature request
Pros: Great, albeit basic, privacy messaging app Cons: Extremely inflexible. Installing Signal on my phone as a primary device and using my tablet as a linked device is not supported. My tablet has a better screen, better camera, better connectivity and is generally a more pleasant device to use for audio & video chats, so not being able to use it means Signal is virtually redundant nowadays, as I prefer to talk to people.	feature request
Would not work told me i needed to create an account and then said i created too many accounts after it kept on erroring out. I tried to log in and it said no account matched the email.

PLEASE DON'T REMOVE SMS SUPPORT. After using Signal for almost 4 years as my go to messaging application for both encrypted and unencrypted messages I was dismayed to see that the latest update now comes with a warning that SMS. support is being removed? WHY? I know that it isn't perfect, but why take this feature away from those who were using Signal for all their messages, making it easier to use Signal with those contacts who have it.	feature request

I personally don't think the new update was necessary. I mean, sure, it looks nice, but it comes with way more bugs than the original layout. For example, if I'm on Discord for a while and someone sends an image, it'll be inlarged , so half of it will show, and I'll have to exit out of the app entirely.	bug report

Good apps. Keep me in contact with my friends. Easy to send text. Only problem is you can't delete individual message like Viber easily.	feature request
Main menu disappeared. Settings are not obvious. If you have Bluetooth connection phone speaker doesn't work. User interface should be inproved significantly. I'm very disappointed.	bug report
New mobile update is a downgrade un usability and requires more clicks to access messages and introduced new bugs such as clicking messages not taking you to the message and instead showing you previous messages from that channel / user.	bug report
The app used to work fine, but then they added an update that completely changed how everything looks. Tabs on the bottom to look more like a social media app. Which I'd be on with but now it's extremely laggy. Changing tabs takes so long you wonder if you tapped the right place. So you press it again, and by the time it loads it recognises both presses separately and takes you somewhere else. I don't see why anything needed to be changed. It worked fine.	bug report
App is great but about 75% of the time I open it I cant reply, react and my emote wheels become to enlarged to use. Have to restart to fix it way too often.	bug report

For some reason, Signal imports around 150 of my 2300 contacts... And I cannot seem to text my mom since she's now no longer in my contacts üò¢ OH, checked my privacy already and I don't seem to be 'hiding' any contacts. Sounds good on paper.	bug report
Last update broke dark theme. `text like this` appears white on white, unreadable. And notifications are kind of messy. They bundle all at once sometimes, and not as they arrive. (Works well on the computer..)	bug report
Latest updates have made the app extremely slow and clunky.	bug report
Text don't go through have the time calls cut out or echo noise and noone can here me most of the time on first call . This app is only good if u can't afford anything but it sucks have the time don't spend any money on it it's a rip off scam	bug report

Great app for encrypted messaging with a lot of great features that work very well.

The latest update for mobile really really sucks! The üìå pins on channels are too hard to find and you can not scroll through them and read the information. The first line of each post that is pinned is shown as some sort of caption, not practical at all. And instead of just reading the pins in the "pins" section, you need to tap each pin to see the information! Absolutely the worst update ever! The pins are completely unusable now, as is the 'search' option! Devs are not even listening to us.	bug report
Sucked big time, it is always hanging	bug report
The app is good but the only thing that sucks about it is I never get notifications for messages or calls I have to click the app every 5 minutes to see if someone messaged or called	bug report
Suddenly from today I cannot receive any messages in signal groups on my phone. I can send and ppl see them. But I don't see what they send me in a group. I can send & receive standard 1 on 1 messages. AND ON DESKTOP I -CAN- send & receive in the group! Also, I can't create a new group from my phone nor from desktop. And if others invite me to a new group I don't see it neither on phone nor on desktop. Signal reports no issues. You had ONE JOB signal! First you trash SMS & now you bork msg sync!	bug report
I like discord but most recent update is not great. The data is terrible at refreshing if I come back into the app from somewhere else so chats don't update even if I got the notification there is a new message. I'm having to close the program (swipe it away) and then re open it to get the chats to update. The new layout is fine, I know folks don't like change, but it's not terrible. It's mainly the data caching and refreshing that I'm struggling with.	bug report
The app doesn't send a verification code to my mobile number. When I wait and ask to call me instead, it requests to pass that "prove you're a human" test, and then again. Nothing happens	bug report

Requires a mobile phone number or it won't let you proceed and requires a password after using Facebook login the point of which is too avoid having tons of passwords for every app, gives the distinct impression of hoovering up unnecessary personal details that could potentially leave you open to fraud, almost seems it is hoping for you to give it your social login password and phone number which is used for 2 factor authentication	feature request

App is unbearably laggy. Wish I could say it's the new ui, but discord lagged before that. The update only made things worse. It now takes 30 secs to load up. Another 30 to switch servers--sometimes just to jump between channels. 80% of the time I have to completely close the app to send or load anything. Don't bother telling me to switch wifi, clear cache/data, uninstall reinstall. I've tried everything, discord. I'VE TRIED. It's not me, it's you. Get your code cleaned up ffs. It's been years!!	bug report
I loved this app but ever since the last update notifications have stopped working. Please fix!!!	bug report
There are many for free this app asking pay at first step should be mentioned at description.	feature request
Good group chat app for school projects. But after an update in the past, it imported hundreds of contacts to the contact list that I have no clue where it's getting them from. I recognize a few as people that I was in a group with in the past, but mkre then half are unrecognizable. I think it imported contacts from other people in 'seven degrees of kevin bacon' fashion, ie if i was in a group with joe before then groupme pulls in all the groupme contacts joe has and shoves them at me as well. This is absurd. But, the most absurd part: it won't let me delete contacts! So, I havee a contact list bloated with hundreds of contacts i don't care about and dont want to see, but groupme wont let me purge them. This is why i knocked off 2 stars. 1 for stupidly importing contacts I DONT WANT AND WITHOUT ASKING ME, and 1 for NOT LETTING ME DELETE THEM. In college / school youre constantly makibg new grouos with new people each semester. But then never see them again. So, over time your contact list is a bloated mess you cant manage. Another group and i got sick of this and just switched to IM group messaging. The folks developing groupme need to stop killing the app with dumb decisions.	bug report

I get to have fun and connect with friends all around the world. A great source to people interested in dungeons and dragons. -edit, 12-6-2023 The new update makes it virtually impossible to access personal chats outside of servers without spending forever to find the person your messaging and then clicking new message to go into the messages. My entire server cannot find how to send a DM to someone.	feature request
The messaging works, calling used to work on the 100 free minutes. When that ran out I bought 400 more and it always says no minutes when I try to make a call. But settings says I have 400 minutes. Sometimes a call it will go through but the other party can't hear me. Had to make a new account and reinstall the app spent another 10$ and it still doesn't work. :(	bug report
It is good app. But many a times it happens that the other side cannot hear my voice so i have to move out of the call and rejoin it. It wastes a lot of time. Even sometimes i and my fellow mates get removed from the call abruptly and the call ends. I request you to please fix this problem. Nevertheless, it gives an oppurtunity to share our screen which is a very useful fearure. I recommend others to install the app . i wish team skype looks into my problem and make updates.	bug report

Initially I gave this App 3-stars. Today, I am taking back two of the stars because I purchased additional minutes a few weeks ago and HAVE NO MINUTES TODAY ALTHOUGH USED I USED IT SPARINGLY IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS. I've only given this app 3-Stars right now because I am still trying to figure out the requirements. Don't know if it's for TEMPORARY or if I can use it INDEFINITELY as a reliable line. ...	bug report
Decent. Works well enough for a free app. Unfortunately, there are advertisements on every single page you open & its slow.	bug report

I subscribed to lock my number to use it overseas, and what I got is that calls do not connect, and I can't receive sms messages from my bank for otp and people can't reach me as it does not ring when somone calls and gives me a missed call message later. Canceled my subscription it is useless.	bug report

Microsoft should stick to the office & OS that they do brilliantly. Skype full bloated, slow, sluggish.. what's originally a platform for making calls now it's become a social media chat & promos. .

I love this app definitely worth the download, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a secondary number whether it be for work or as an alternative number if you have a prepaid phone number and can not afford a phone card. Works great a little to many adds,that is the only reason I can't score it a 5 star	irrelevant information
Got it specifically to use while out of USA because my techie brother told me to, so me and my traveling companions could communicate with each other as well as the kids back home. Worked great. But I'm technically incompetent so I can't even explain why we needed it. But regular phone calls and texting didn't work, but this app allowed us to make phone calls and send messages.	irrelevant information

Been using discord for years and the recent update made navigation a complete nightmare, the swipe left to replay is so annoying when all I want to do it swipe left to see who is currently online in the server, I use this way more then replying to people, generally I'll just tag someone rather than replying. Also removing the private chat from the top of the server list to a new tab at the bottom of the page is also very annoying and I've missed so many private messages because of this change.	feature request
I can't sign in through Google. It won't sync or something.	bug report
I use it for work related group messaging. The three stars is because although there are some good features to the app.. I feel like it's been the same for 5 years. It needs an update with new features. Also, I feel like.. if you want to delete a chat you should be allowed to even if you're not the creator of the chat.	feature request
I love the app, it's way better than a regular group chat. but for some reason all my conversations are blank now, like I've never talked to anyone.	bug report

Here is something wrong with my App, i cannot make calls! What's the issue!?	bug report
Today, 4/24/23, I was forced to update signal since it is "expired." I heard about signal removing SMS support so I quit updating it in Feb. I was able to use signal fully yesterday, SMS and all, today I must update or uninstall. Why has this company become so aggressive with this rollback in functionality? Leave us alone if we want to run an old version that will work with SMS so that we don't have to use 2 apps. 1/5 stars, would not recommend.	bug report
this app was fine but it immediately went down in value for me when i realized verification codes were behind a paywall. confidently signing up for a website so i can make money in the first place! but i can't even verify. this app is as good as useless for me now. im uninstalling the moment i get a mobile device, because i seriously needed to sign up for this job. üíÄ NVM.	feature request
Edit: Up to two stars because the message now appears consistently when I hit send, even though it doesn't disappear from the text entry box consistently yet. The new UI is so buggy. I keep having to close and restart the app due to the buttons not responding, or in the case of the send message button, posting the message without showing me it has posted. There was nothing wrong with the old one, I don't understand why this change was considered necessary.	bug report
The layout should NOT make me take 20 seconds to load where I am going, I wouldn't mind the new version if it was at least usable but it's not. It's really disappointing to see how they ruin their app with unnecessary features	feature request

I recently updated the app and the new user interface is trash. The design feels cluttered and counterintuitive, making navigation a frustrating experience. Moreover, the verification system seems to be malfunctioning. despite having a stable Wi-Fi connection, I couldn't use the verification code sent to my number. This has ruined my time on this app.	bug report
To glitchy	bug report
Would be a 5 if discord would address the issue with using Bluetooth headphones while using the mobile app. I use disc every day on my PC and it's amazing. However, when I join voice chat on the mobile app, the audio only comes through the phone (headset mode) or loudspeaker. Audio won't play from earbuds. I've googled everything and this problem goes back almost 2 years now without discord providing a fix. The company appears to not care about mobile discord users at all.	bug report
It was okay most times	irrelevant information
Was a great messaging app but the sms messaging is going away so I have no use for this app at all	feature request
I've used Discord since 2017, and for the vast majority of it's life I have been quite satisfied with this service. The past couple years however, it has taken to adding various features and changes which serve only to make it more like other apps. For awhile this has just been minorly annoying tech homogeny, but with the most recent UI change things have been needlessly shifted around, video and image sharing in mobile was broken, as well as various other issues. Would not recommend right now.	bug report
i don't know if this is happening for anyone else, but whenever i try to connect to a voice call it just says "connecting" despite my connection being perfectly fine. no matter how many times i restart the app, nothing works. this can be incredibly frustrating when i'm trying to call with my friends but the app won't connect me. i've not been able to join a call on my phone for a while now because of this issue.	bug report
it's all good. i like the changes you guys have made and the designs for the logo. the function of the swipe left on a message is extremely helpful, especially on quick time arguments. very customizable and very convenient. i only disagree on the whole NITRO nonsense. i feel as it is too irrelevant to pay for a banner. nonetheless, very good.	feature request
Finding out about this app was amazing, but ever since I got the update, I haven't been able to use the in-app camera. Meaning I can't send photos with the camera in discord without using my actual camera and it sucks, cause then I can't send the photo in a moving car Update: can we add a quick switch of discord accounts like in the PC version? I think it'll be an amazing add!	feature request
Discord is very good app. But the app is sometimes not work well. sometime it stuck when tap on DMs. I wish you fix that problem üòï	bug report

It would be 5 stars but for some reason i cant join certain servers.	bug report
New mobile layout is TERRIBLE! Ever since the last update, I've missed multiple messages and notifications because everything is buried in a generic layout that's slow and frustrating to navigate! I'm uninstalling this from all of my mobile devices until they add an option to use the old layout. It looks like a worse version of the Facebook Messenger. So much for being an original and functioning app. I'll be looking for an alternative and canceling Nitro immediately.	feature request

Please revert some of the recent changes, they have made the app so difficult to use on mobile. The channel sorting feature was just fine and very easy to use how it was, now its a borderline unusable feature.

it is good but you run out of minutes to fast a good thing for them to let you know is that you can go into your settings on the app then at the very top Osage earn minutes by watching videos and that is a great way to get some back but since they're called text free you think that they're texting and calling would be free because Text Plus call free yeah but other than that it's all good.	irrelevant information

It used to be a great app. Since last few weeks it's unusable. It auto defen the VC when opening the game screen. The sound comes back as soon as you switch from game screen to any other screen - discord, another app etc. I don't have this problem when logging through the website, it's the app issue. Removing the app and installing fresh didn't help. 1 star Edit: The newest update made things even worse. It's hard to navigate between servers and friends messages. No access to friends list.

I've purchased two sim card's, but never received them.

It is interesting that the app also sends it as a text. I would prefer not to get both.	feature request
It's great! Works well, responsive, and good for group chats. Only issue I have is notifications. Too many and it groups them together but the first one it shows is the earliest one.	feature request
STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP! I woke up to my account being closed and they never gave me a legit reason why! I lost all my family contacts and my mother has just died. I am completely devastated.

Used to be a great app, but it's completely broken after the last update.	bug report
Hurry tf up and download	irrelevant information
I like the original version of the app. But the new version is honestly not making any sense. Let's talk about the calls. I have this friend I usually call but for some reason, her mic had this little icon that is like not letting her speak, although her equipment and my equipment is working and I've been trying to fix it but I can't even email discord support, because they won't let me log into my account. I'm honestly giving up.	bug report
This app is so annoying, always force close and lagging for no reason.	bug report
When I'm using the app- dont mind pop up ads. While I am texting or on my other apps- stay the hell off my screen!!! Thats a little bit much and its irritating. I'm uninstalling now. Whats worse is, I'll be TEXTING SOMEONE and an ad will pop up. REALLY??!!! Stay off my stuff. Show your stupid ads when the app is open. You have no right to otherwise.	bug report

I really like discord actually, but their QA testing is the worst. Their latest update broke uploading video files on mobile AGAIN. That's right, again. As in it happened before and somehow it's a happened again. How can a basic function go overlooked in multiple updates? Again, I love using Discord, and I even pay for Nitro, but the constant failures to get basic things right is wearing on me.	bug report

A hot glitchy mess, screens only half display when rotated lots, and of the last update, cameras just don't load 90% of the time, before it was either a frozen frame of them or a loading screen. But now it just doesn't load, and for some reason latley every time I join, everyones cameras are disabled and I have to manually turn them on. They work for a bit but then quit. I honestly miss the old mobile discord. Still a love hate relationship with this app	bug report
December 2023 layout change is yet another example of UI change for its own sake. It makes things that have been in the same place for years much more difficult to find, for absolutely no reason.

This new mobile UI is terrible. It makes navigation a pain, and when I click into a chat it is messages above my last sent reply, so I have to scroll down to even see current messages. You can't swipe to see members of a server anymore, and the new UI made it so the soundboard on mobile is glitched out and can't be used either. Seeing the VC icon in the corner is so distracting, and I hate seeing everyone's icons above the messages. Look at the new reviews and star rating. New UI was a mistake.	feature request

I use Discord every single day and I love it, it would be have been 5* if they kept the same old ui. The new UI is horrible and it constantly glitches and bugs at every given second. Even clicking notifications will cause a frozen screen and to fix it is to close the app completely. It's an okay UI and I'm already a bit used to it but the change is sudden and it's annoying to use the app now.	bug report
Works smoothly and is way better than my native (Samsung) messaging app. I especially like the "Note to Self" feature.	feature request

I used to love using the app, but the latest updates have been so frustrating. I have a Samsung s9. As a mod I am now unable to add emjois to channel names.

The new UI update, with no option for the old version, is NOT helpful. As someone who is Neurodivergent, this change coming around the holidays makes me upset. I can no longer also utilize DND mode as it will still notify me, and it's hard to navigate because the layout is WILDLY different now. l already was having issues in VC, this just made the app even more clunky and annoying. I have to keep using it because I have built up connections on here, but at what cost? Please go back.	feature request
Waist of my time did not work on my phone	bug report
It takes long to load its bad	bug report
the app worked great at first no problems with sending or receiving messages. and no problems making phone calls for the 60 mins they credit you. after that the app begins crashing not allowing anything to come thru or go out. Also it doesn't give you credits for completing offers. Nor does it show that you completed an offer. if theses issues can be fixed my rating and review will be better. Could be a great app if fixed.	bug report
The newest update makes the app feel more complicated to use than before. I absolutely loved the layout and abilities before the update, as did my friends. I particularly miss being able to swipe right and see others in a server, and the old way private messages would appear instead of separately. I'll update with a higher rating if things get better but as of right now I'm just not very happy with it...	feature request

What's with this new "chatting about" notification? Its so creepy and unwanted. Why the hell is discord actively following our conversations and announcing it to everyone in the server?

Please stop with the random updates and ask the community if they'd like something before you force it on us.	feature request

the last update is awful. it was good as it was, now things are just harder and more annoying. ..also reminds me too much of Facebook's Messenger app. too overwhelming. i haven't found anything i like about the recent update. i would have liked it if there was an option to have it like it used to look. choosing one's own layout. as some people like this update and others such as myself absolutely not.	feature request
I wish this app would nest notifications. It is annoying to have your notification shade cluttered with 5+ separate message notifications. 1 saying I have 5+ messages is sufficient. Repeating my request.	feature request
This is great app I have used it for years the only bad problem is the kicking out of calls for 3 minutes over then that it's a good app	bug report
One of the slowest and most unresponsive app I've ever used. Refuses to start, wastes lots of time in updating conversation and so on and so forth. Notifications are late, connectivity is bad. I first wrote this review 3 months ago, but not a line in response from the developer team. Why this callous attitude????	bug report
Really pissing me off, can't send photos at all, time to use a different app for messaging	bug report

Worst app too loading in send msg	bug report
terrible UI update as of December 2023. channels do not load properly, switching between discords is slow and also may not load correctly. previous version was much smoother. hopefully these issues get fixed	bug report
It's not as private as I was thinking it should be! The case being any signal user can barge in on your account without permission when it's a private conversation!	bug report
the worst! i bought nitro and its not working, my money is already gone and i wasted it over nothing! i literally bought it and said i was subscribe but i don't even have my nitro badge	bug report
I like the app the problem is I cant delete any of the conversations or calls so I'm not clogging up my phone with wasted space. Can you fix this?	feature request
This app is bloated and requires too many permissions, but gets the job done.  Has saved me $20/mo for 4 years.	irrelevant information
Does what it says...but it's not free?	irrelevant information
#1 Every time I pick up an incoming call the caller has to call me a few times in a row because they can't hear me. Then in mid conversation they would have to hang up and call back because they couldn't hear me. #2 every time I try to do surveys or watch videos or download games to receive minutes I never get them. Never. It frustrates me when I do things to get minutes and I get nothing in return. These 2 reasons is why I rate you with 3 stars.	bug report
It works for a while then says it doesn't support any of my numbers when it did this morning and stopped calls and no one can call me I need to get calls I work at home	bug report
I love discord and have for MANY many years. I'm gonna give it a 4/5 for these reasons 1)I can no longer send voice messages through my phone 2)when you're gifted nitro, you're not able to upload a different server picture, change the background, etc. I love discord. Those are my only 2 issues	feature request

Bought the sim card and did every step and even every step in trouble shoot. Doesn't work. Don't waste your money. Doesn't work without wifi no matter what.	bug report
Serves it's purpose of providing free calling and texting, however I've been having trouble with notifications. It seems the app will only notify me of a new text or missed call when the app is open and refreshed. This has made keeping up a conversation a bit difficult given I'm not notified when I'm being messaged or called. I've tried every suggestion I could find to fix this but nothing seems to work. Might just be my phone at this point.	bug report
It seems to much like instagram and snapchat... All social media apps are becoming to alike. I liked it before the update.	irrelevant information

This application runs in conjunction with your device phone and serves as an excellent second phone number. All the useful services such as voicemail come as a standard. I like the fact you can choose from a number on a list provided for choices of your second /alternate phone #. No dropped calls or static calls.	irrelevant information

Works as expected. Great messaging app in place of built-in phone or Google text messaging. 2023 edit: Removal of Sms. How hard would it be to leave it as is? But now we have to use another program for standard sms. I have way more sms contacts them encrypted sms.	feature request
so far I'm really enjoying this app!	irrelevant information
It used to be simple and great, but ever since major changes were made, I am unable to use the app properly No matter where I click I can't close the chat that was open when I started the app, I can receive notifications but can't access the newest messages because the app is stuck a few minutes in the past... it's brutally annoying always having to close and open the app to get it working	bug report

I pay for credits here and there to make calls to doctors offices and other appointments, it's somewhat par, with phone calls breaking up. My internet is amazing so that can't be blamed for calls with limited reception. But the biggest phone is when you have to push numbers like for the pharmacy, it pushes too many numbers together. It's just to much to handle. I'm just going with another app that has less problems. Don't waste your time, this app will only frustrate you	bug report
Normal cellular call rates are much cheaper than Skype subscription in India. I can't find a good reason to subscribe	irrelevant information
I've used signal for a long time, and promoted it to many people, but with the announcement that SMS support is being dropped, I am now planning to drop it like a hot potato and move on. This is just not cool, and makes little sense whatsoever. Whitlw it has never been my favorite security solution, it was convenient being able to have moderate security AND standard SMS in a single app, but this change is just a deal-breaker and unacceptable for my and so many other's needs.	feature request

Please fix the server connection of discord, messages takes too long to load and sometimes cannot even connect to the voice channels in phone, I don't experience this on my pc so it is not a net problem or phone problem since I could connect just fine on other apps. Last UI is also nice for us who tend to use discord on pc while gaming, if you could let the user choose between UIs it would be nice. Hopefully you'll be able to fix this soon, it's been going on for 3updates already.	feature request

Some bugs sometimes but it's cool	bug report
The new update has completely mangled their user interface. It used to be easy to find things, see how many messages you had and from who, lists of people in a given server... and now all of that is gone. This went from a very easy to use app that was one of the best mobile apps on my phone, to one of the worst in literally one update. I will be recommending people not to download Discord and to hold off updating for as long as possible due to the disasterous UI change.	feature request
Development has really slowed down over the past few years. Instead of making improvements their latest big change was removing integrated SMS support which is the main reason many people started to use the app. In comparison with Telegram, Signal is way behind and loosing market share. I'll probably keep using Signal for a little while longer before looking for a new alternative.	irrelevant information
Run without email	irrelevant information
I have used this app for a long time but for the last couple months it has been buggy. Normally when I would get a text message I would here my notification sound and I would get a pop up on my screen, but now I don't get any notification that I have a text message. And the only way I would see that I have a text message is by opening the app and letting it load for a while. I have tried reinstalling the app, updating it, and using other pinger apps with my number but nothing really works.	bug report

This is a great app for everyone to chat with their friends. Unlike other apps, you don't need a phone number to use this app. All you need is an email account and you can chat to as many people as you want. You can also join some amazing server and share your interests with other people. The only bad thing is some bugs and the fact that you can only add 10 people to a group chat. Anymore than 10 and you need to make a server.	feature request
Terrible lack of functions. Can't access a full call history, no option to turn on speakerphone. These are really basic functions for a phone call app to have, every other similar app has them. What is going on with the development that such fundamental features are missing? Is the development team on strike? Is microsoft trying to slowly kill Skype instead of pulling the plug?	feature request

This platform genuinely keeps worsening itself. The UI change was utterly pointless and disorienting. This app DIDN'T NEED those changes. You don't need to make it more of an eyesore and more horrible to use. Why don't you do a sensible thing and don't give into brain-dead investors. That would make us all so much happier. The only good side this platform has is the communities, and these have existed independently of this tripe so that's irrelevant.	feature request

Back 10 years ago, Skype was the king of communication. Every update since then has made it worse n worse... So many useless features and problems. Servers often disconnect.

Sort it out Skype... go back to 2000 version please when it was doing what it should be.	bug report

I would like the app fixed so I can go back to being able to use it. Thanks.	bug report
Can't get app to download to my phone....not good!!!!	bug report
New update is absolutely awful. Usability has gone down the drain, and all the devs say is "you'll get used to it" in spite of mass user dislike. If you are looking for a ui that makes sense and is easy to use, stick to desktop. This update is terrible.	feature request

Great app, with one problem: on my old Samsung Galaxy S3 and my new S5, I frequently won't get any notifications even though I have notifications turned on. Other than this I'd give it a 5/5 but it's kind of a big problem for me.	bug report
I tried the new UI, never again. It is objectively worse than before, with very common functionality being stuck behind 2-3 taps when before it was just one, or just a swipe. Maybe, just maybe, listen to community feedback instead of repeating the same "read the manual nerd" response. People KNOW how to navigate the new app. It's just WORSE.	feature request
Update 1/31/2022: Ever since I activated my new SIM from TextNow, calls are dropped when I am on my WiFi network. It keeps trying to reconnect and I need to hang up my phone. If I turn off WiFi, the mobile LTE network works and call isn't dropped. Way to run up my mobile data usage!! Hopefully this can be fixed. I want to be able to make and receive calls regardless of the network I'm on. I followed SIM activation instructions, so I don't think that is the issue.	bug report

Beware if you install this app and then decide you no longer want it you will never be able to completely get rid of it. This is the app from hell and doesn'tdeserveeven one star!

Great app for communicating with friends, but I have a problem while sorting the roles in my servers. It keeps letting me placed incorrectly where I want it to be.

I would give 5 stars if it still included regular sms. I don't see what was wrong with a messaging app that encrypts when possible. It was an easy sell to people before the change. Please go back.	feature request

I mean it's discord, it's better than any other voice service I've used, organization through servers and DMs is simple enough that it's easy to understand, but powerful enough to run servers with thousands of people. If any parents are wondering, it's safe for your kids to use, as long as they are responsible (don't expose personal info, seek out explicit content). Pros: Clean interface Easy 2 use Server-specific names Custom emojis Easy 2 connect ... Cons: Notifs can be unreliable on mobile	irrelevant information

Well the new update is a nightmare. I wish I could go back to the standard call look.

New UI is Buggy AF this is my go-to app for games and general communication with my online friends but the new UI is really buggy there are time when it's still showing the same channel that I was in prior to switching. My BIGGEST suggestion to the devs. Start doing Beta test downloads for those that opt-in to testing the UI or any new features with a bug report function. This also applies to the desktop/laptop application. Guarentee that it works good example is Steam.	bug report
Removing sms was such a boneheaded move. It completely removed the main reason to use signal over any other sms app. Now it's just yet another messaging app glutting up the market. Every other messaging app offers end-to-end encryption nowadays, so what's the point of this app now?	feature request
I'm new here but it's been great so far. No complaints! Looking forward to the video call performance tho...so I'll give it a 4-star cuz I haven't explored that yet and I'll be using it a lot in the future Insha Allah.	irrelevant information
it is slowsometimesand it eats up my data	bug report
"Best chat application on mobile that syncs with other devices." This was true. Then they made a UI update that leaves channels up as I navigate between servers. Pulling up messages between people is also broken for the same reason. From what I can tell, if I load into a channel, I'm stuck on that channel. I will be removing a star each time this bug occurs.	bug report
It has lots of issues and when screen is shared sound is not working at all	bug report
Sends my pictures hours later. Recipients are confused, I'm embarrassed. It's just a big mess. Notifications and incoming calls don't notify most of the time. Full page ad blocks what I'm doing and sometimes its difficult to figure out how to get it off. 1/3 page ads are very common and also very annoying. I'm going to try another ap. Update 5/8/23 I don't use this app very much anymore, but it still is very unpredictable and unreliable, especially when sending and receiving pics.	bug report
This app worked fine, but recently I've been unable to call. Or send messages. Our wifi isn't the best, but the app just won't let me video call or send messages. It always just says "cOnNeCtInG..." with the little loading sign thigimie spinning like mad. No. üò∂üòëüòí	bug report
The main reason I give this a 3/5 is because: 1. Even if you're texting someone in your phone list, their name doesn't show on the app even if you have contacts access enabled. 2. No notifications on my Galaxy S8 anymore from this application. Been an issue since two updates ago. I've tried every setting possible and reinstalling the app. Didn't solve it at all.	bug report

App sometimes shows *nothing* in the call logs. The most common time it won't show your call logs? When you've missed a call. That's not dropping the ball; that's slamming it in your grandmothers grave. Call quality is mostly okay; the amount of issues is equal to that of regular carriers: maybe a dropped call or bad connection once every month or two. Edit: it no longer shows a call log; ever.	bug report

Unusable and buggy garbage! Not sure what has happened to this once amazing app, but now it's impossible to use. As an early adopter I'm so disappointed to see this app is now just filled with unnecessary bloatware, which is clucky at best and unresponsive and constantly hangs at its abject worst! The usability is non-existant. It's really a travesty that Microsoft have been allowed to so hobble this once beloved app, which is now a scammer and sex worker riddled cesspit.

Discord is a good app. However, it's too convoluted. Plus, there doesn't seem to be good instructions for new users trying to set the app up for the first time. Streamline the process, and use the KIS method, Keep It Simple. On the plus side, love the fact that I can talk, leave messages, and share my screen with this app. It is a great tool when needing to collaborate with people that are not geographically close.	feature request

However, if I PAY money, I can keep it. Is that not FRAUD and EXTORTION?! And once again, Google allows it. Why? Does Google receive a percentage? And now some cs rep suggested that the only way they can help, is if I uninstall & reinstall. The problem is on there end not mine. So I filed a complaint for fraud & extortion.	bug report

Been using Discord for years. They are always adding more unnecessary features but occasionally I do appreciate some. However, the Android app in specific always gets UI overhauls for the worse, and the latest update changes the UI to be so terribly designed that it made me want to leave a review simply to capitalize on how much it screams of developers not using their own application. I have a few connections here but unnecessary changes like this made me consider moving on to an alternative.	feature request

It is a GREAT product ... but it won't work (for long) if you use a VPN.	bug report
Personally, i love the new ui, but there should definitely be an option to turn it off, especially for older users who much prefer the old ui. Also, please add a feature that displays what game you're playing on the status. I'm sure a lot of mobile Discord users would enjoy this new addition.	feature request

I Love discord dearly, but the latest update making it look like FB messenger was the worst idea. The icons look like they were designed for children/teens.

lots of constant bugs and glitches - not consistent with notifications, random times/days, the app from my laptop won't allow me to add contacts, etc.... would love to be contacted by developers fro assistance and/or a ne wupdate fixing these issues as well as others!!!	bug report
This app used to be really good, but the last three to five-ish big updates made it significantly worse. The app is way laggier, sometimes I need to turn airplane mode on and off again to get it to load, the Username update was poorly rolled out and unwanted(there's already a black market for "good" UNs), and upcoming updates don't look very appealing. Reversing the UN update would be a good place to start, but for now I'm turning updates off. Glad I never got Nitro.	bug report
Awesome thank you so much	irrelevant information
While the new UI is awful, the functionality is what really bugs me. The amount of times I have to force close and re open the app for anything to work is unnacceptable. I could accept a UI change if the rest of the update wasn't half baked.	bug report

I like it but please fix it cause i have to keep rephreshing just to get my friends msg.	bug report
Very buggy, slow, and unreliable. It calls, it texts, and sends photos. But to do this comes at a cost. You'll be smacked with ads designed to show up perfectly timed so you click them while typing, the app will slow your entire phone down, and will most likely crash often. If you receive a call I pitty you, because your entire devices will have no clue how to react and freeze completely. Recommended as a last resort.	bug report
Open source, End to end encrypted, Encrypts metadata, Run by a foundation that isnt sold out, Endorced by people like Snowden, Musk and important security experts throughout the globe, Can work as Replacement for the stock messaging app, And a user interface thats easily understood for someone coming from popular messaging apps , signal checks a lot of boxes. All thats left now would be to implement a feature to hide the phone number and find user by ID much the same way you can do in telegram	feature request

Keeps giving me notifications that my number is expiring when I in fact send outbound texts almost daily. I don't know if this a glitch or a grab for money, but it's annoying because my number *has not* expired. At this point, it's almost worth it to just pay the cell phone company for a second line so that I don't have to use an app that begs for money everyday. Also, there are unskippable video ads that take up the whole screen. Not worth it!	bug report

The new update has made sending voice notes nearly impossible. If we have to release the rolling press to hit send on a voice message, but releasing the long press also cancels the voice message, no voice message can be sent. How did this get screwed up so bad, it was fine the way it was.	bug report
Great app until they took away my favorite feature. They announced they are removing SMS. I really liked having a secure messaging system and SMS available within a single app. I was able to keep all my conversations in one place. It was great when I had a friend or family who refused to get signal. I don't really plan on using signal anymore without this feature.	feature request
This app is basically a paperweight and serves no function. It doesn't support usernames or VoIP phone numbers, and is soon dropping support for SMS. So what is the point? Is it supposed to be secure? Why not just send an SMS, you already need a phone number yo use the app anyway	bug report

Attempted to email customer service 2xs never recieved a reply. i dont even care about a refund I just want to answer this call to give a different app# & delete it	bug report
For some unknown reason when I'm in a voice chat using my earbuds, it will just suddenly switch to using my phone's speaker numerous times. I'm not switching it or anything. It does it on it's own and it'll say I'm still connected through wired earbuds even though it's clearly not. It's been super annoying.	bug report
In general it's ok, but sometimes calls don't come in time, just there are missing call notifications and it annoys by sending push notifications about active call every couple of seconds while I'm in that call.	bug report

During most all calls incoming/outgoing the quality of service is the lowest to sporadic to nearly nonexistent..I mean the Best Rate I can give the quality of Service I have been getting through this text free app is a 2 outta a possible 0-10 & 10 being the highest...Mainly due to the fact that During every call incoming or outgoing after about 5-10 minutes of Reasonably Clear Service after those few minutes the person your speaking to can no longer hear you but you hear them!!! It's frustratin	bug report
To me is always on time when I need to make a important call	irrelevant information
I had some difficulties signing up through the app, but I managed to create an account and choose a phone number on the textnow website. I tried calling a friend without using wifi, and it worked. I decided to lock the number, which is a great price. The rating went from 0 to 5/5.	irrelevant information

Befor this update, almost everything was good, would have given 5 starts. But the new ui... It is not Discord! The DMs look like Messenger, and the "swipe left to view members" thing is gone, and thus the signature Discord look that was near perfect is destroyed. The app now looks like any generic chat app. As mentioned before, the DMs look like Messenger, and I use Discord so I don't have to use Meta's stuff. 2/5	feature request
As soon as I created an account I got suspended???	bug report

This is the best app I've ever used for when I would have no phone service text now was always there with my same phone number and all my contacts. The only problem was I would have almost full wifi and there would be a problem with the calls. Either couldn't hear me or dropped outta no where even if I had 2 bars or 3 of wifi but some times it wasn't the app with the problem it was the weak wifi. Hey free service and now .99 cent service I think that's pretty awesome to me.	feature request
I paid for almost 200 minutes that I had removed then was banned after I complained about them taking them	bug report
Have used signal for years and loved every bit of it, but now with plans to drop SMS support the app will be almost entirely useless for me. It was easy to get non-tech savy family and friends to use it, since it was the only app they needed, but why would anyone want to have to juggle more than one messaging app? I hope they listen to the feedback and revert this decision, but if it goes tbrough, I simply can't recommend Signal to anyone.	feature request
Terrible ever changing user interface. Typical MS making easy things	bug report
It doesn't always push notifications (they're on) and I don't receive all messages in our server. So messages are missing in mine, that others receive. I only use one server to community with 3 others, so it's not a big group.	bug report
Was a great app for connecting with friends and playing games before the mobile update. Things are clunky, and it's rather inconvenient to use. Traveling between messages and group chats is weird. You can easily and accidentally go places you don't want to, and it's just not good. Please remove this update from mobile.	bug report

reinstalled the app several times. It's very frustrating. I hate it.	bug report
Discord is obviously a good and popular app, but on android its been a pretty bumpy road, ever since they merged with the apple version it seems as if there are new glitches and issues every week and every update serves to hurt the experience, so many issues to list but one I got recently is that if I leave the app and come back messages dont load sometimes and i have to close it all the way out, another is that sometimes it just stops me from scrolling up or down in the middle of the chat log.	bug report
i love the app but can someone please tell me why 70%of the time i get a notification when someone messages and 30%of the time i do not.... it's annoying, people think im ignoring then when actually i just didn't get a notification and don't see a message UNTIL i open the app. So what's the problem now discord?! I open the app and nothing shows up. It was working fine until your newest update.	bug report
Great for company chat.	irrelevant information

The discontinuation of SMS was the beginning of the end for Signal because a separate SMS app is required until 100% of all messages are on Signal - a day that will never arrive. It used to be easy for others to switch to Signal because they gained privacy with a growing group of users without the inconvenience of two (or more) messaging Apps. I hope SMS is added back before Signal ceases to exist.	feature request
hasnt been letting me make calls and fails to send txt a lot.	bug report
Frustrating app. Someone calls but by the time yout answer ir head ashtray cut off. I will ditch skype soon if they do not sort it out...	bug report
Deleting due to loss of SMS compatibility. Very disappointing because this app was fantastic.	feature request
it's good but there are adds rated 4	irrelevant information
Really great app! That was until the announcement of dropping sms. That function was part of what made this app desirable. I hope Signal will reconsider and allow sms.	feature request
11 july update makes it impossible to open servers on mobile :( app instantly crashes. hoping for a fix soon!	bug report
Something wrong with this app. i m using for long time. The power consumption is abnormal. Can suck the battery in 4h. 9% today. It sounds bad..hope a new private messenger because this one cannot be trusted anymore for high level of privacy	bug report
Finally got it working	bug report
It's not free you gotta pay, trust me. They say is it's is but its not.	irrelevant information
HATE IT! Would love to delete this app if I didn't need it.. Horrible design.. Big and bulky app.. No notification without being on the app and even though in signed in it always shows me as offline I miss all call even when I'm on the app.. I need the old version back! It's the only way I can speak to my family face to face as they live hundreds of miles away from me..	bug report
Change the name. The *APP* is free, but in order to use it AT ALL you have to buy the sub.	feature request
Today Skype chats aren't right. The search bar cuts off my top chat when in my chat list. Also calls keep disconnecting and don't work with some games despite discord working perfectly.	bug report
Discord was my most used app. It was slick and filled with great functionality. It still has a lot of functionality, but lost it's slick part. It's sluggish, it crashes, it's slow, and unfortunately, the UI/UX decisions are not comfortable. Aside from the obvious downgrade that it's no longer in parity with the PC design, the new layout isn't intuitive. And look at the date of the review, I took my sweet time to understand and try to learn it. It didn't work.	bug report

Would be nice the app would avoid continuous nagging (notifications) with irrelevant content about additional features (mostly irrelevant like possibility to change colors or discuss with Bing...). Honestly keep it simple and quite. If it has to become an other social media platform, we already have far too many.	feature request
They are changing the app to only work if the person you're texting also has the app. I can't make people use it. That's a huge problem for me. Will be uninstalling.	bug report
Great app, just a massive shame the dev team constantly break previous updates added content every update. I liked being able to use those super reacts I paid for, and when the server profiles worked without random bugs, and when spoiler tags weren't randomly disabled client-side on mobile for no reason Honestly rather sad, it almost feels like they use mobile as a test bed As long as you can deal with stuff randomly not working and the search function being made basically useless, you're golden	bug report
Great way to communicate with teams and families	irrelevant information
One starring it for the absolutely backwards decision to upend how 99% of us got people to use Signal, by having them replace their SMS app with it.	feature request
This is my first sm and I do not regret it	irrelevant information
my contacts can not call me it goes straight to voicemail but overall it is a good straight forward app	bug report
There are still some annoying bugs on Android, like not being able to listen to long voice messages, hold to record dialog image floating around over the app, and random crashes, but overall the app works and provides a great communication experience for all.	bug report
I can no longer make calls and when I do all it does is freeze up or it will ring Non-Stop and never start a call. Ever since this last update I can not keep in contact with my husband or my family. This is terrible....	bug report

Removing SMS support is a terrible blow to this otherwise excellent app. I understand the reasons given by the Signal team, but I disagree with them.

There are several issues going on here. First would be that the app barley runs in the first place, 9 times out of 10 always crashes and your forced to restart it. And when it does work you only have a few seconds of freedom before lag forcibly takes over, usually resulting in another crash. Second will be the fact that voice chat doesn't even work anymore. Everytime I join one it keeps disconnecting and reconnecting me with the chat, resulting in no one being able to hear you at all	bug report

I paid for the $4.99 to lock in my number so I can receive codes and I was highly disappointed. Additionally I asked for a refund because I can't use the service for what I purchased it for and have not been able to contact customer service. Text now is also very choppy even on WiFi with a good connection.	bug report
So, I used to have a discord account, but after some time, I deleted the app. Now, when I try to log back in, it doesn't let me. This makes me so mad, and I would honestly rate 0 stars if I could. DON'T DELETE THE APP UNTIL YOU DELETE YOUR DISCORD ACCOUNT Response: I have tried both of those and neither have worked. Your solution to an issue caused by deleting the app is for me to delete it again? That got me into this mess, why would it fix it?	bug report
It had its problems since that ominous update in summer but now I gotta restart the app every 10minutes because there will always be something that will just never load.	bug report

The new update is disappointing. The original layout was fine, and even better than the new layout. I'll change my review if the layout is changed, or at least back to normal.	feature request
If you need a phone number for any reason, I would recomend this app. But I am only giving it 2 stars because it requires you to text someone all the time or else it basically deletes your account.	feature request
It was very awesome. Now it is not good. I have to force close the app to change channels. Fire whoever pushed this update and go back to the previous build. I can't start a new channel in a new category until I make the thing and then go back.	bug report

This was a very good app, but I hate the new layout and wish there were an option to change it back. Nobody asked for a change and nobody likes it. I'm surprised you haven't already changed it due to how far the app's rating has dropped. The app's drop in rating proves how nobody supports this change, yet you still won't budge. At least now I havr something to complain about in my school's newsletter. Until it is changed, this review will remain at one star.	feature request
The app used to work well. Now I have to download it every time I want to use it. It works once then the second time I try to open it, it shows the Skype logo, then disappear.	bug report
It's a good app, but I don't like the new username feature, like, you can't even use fonts, emojis or anything interesting for your username, and some people including me don't even have it yet, I'll admit, it'll be easier to work with since you don't have to remember everyones # at the end of the name, but atleast let us make our username interesting, me and my friend have been trying to think of users for HOURS because we can't use our old ones.	feature request

Became less gamer friendly and went corporate to cater the mainstream(no problem with that) but the app is less fun than what it used to.

Voicemail. I use this a a business ph. I have a customer greeting saved. But constantly when customers call it says the number you are calling doesn't have a voicemail setup.

I also requested and paid for a sim kit that months ago amd still have not received it.	bug report
Very good app, expect the roles channels setting, etc etc. But yes this app is very good and I do not have any problem with notifications. The new UI is just extremely awful it always lags and it's so hard to make roles or servers in the new UI update not very good...	feature request

I like this app. The only problem is sometimes it will not make calls or you can't hear the other person that you call but it does work 98% of the time. So yes get this app if you are low on funds because you can watch 3 to 5 minutes of ads and get over an hour if not more of call time.

As well as that, whenever I go to the app and I'm just seeing who's active and who's not, it's been saying that people "Haven't been seen in days" when they were active just a few minutes ago. Very odd and would greatly appreciate it if it could be fixed. Have a splendid day!	bug report

Was the perfect app for my 2nd phone that way I could give that number to most people and only give my main number to whom I wanted. I was fine with the ad banners, they weren't too intrucive. Unfortunately now ads constantly (after every couple texts) show up in text conversations that look like text bubbles and it's $360+ dollars a year to get rid of them? Forget it, I'll just go get a cheap plan for my 2nd phone this weekend. Thanks for being useful for a while, though.	bug report

I don't understand what Discord's goals are past a certain point. For the last.. around 10 major updates, they've been progressively adding more and more personalisation settings, things like the unique statuses found only when in call. But while they're doing that, they're simultaneously breaking other functions like AMOLED dark mode. As it stands, the basic chatroom functionality of it is.. Fine. It's not good, and it's certainly not secure, but it's functional. that's the best it's got.	feature request

Needs to have an easier path to delete txts. Should hold down a msg and have options right away. The GUI isn't the best and there are too many clickables to get what I need.

After interface change, channels are getting stuck on my app and others will not open. So if I am in the general channel and then switch to another channel it continues to show the general channel, but it shows I am in another channel.

I would enjoy it more if it gave me the capability to edit my posts. I should have the option to choose actions that are shared; If I make a change, add or delete someone, that should not be publicized.

The invitation to join should be clear and precise that you must respond within a certain time frame in order to keep receiving messages, also the app won't allow you to return after leaving group.	feature request

Since the UI update, the app really seems to have degraded in performance. For example; Randomly just not setting any messages to read. When opening a chat, just being about 2 pages of scrolling up the chat for some bizarre reason. UI is now just sometimes completely non responsive for a few seconds. This plus the absolute overhaul of the UI to remove some functions, I'm not entirely sure what discord were thinking. It seems to be completely untested and the UX is now completely awful.	bug report
My app contacts text messages come hours late. I text back they don't receive my texts messages and I wonder why they don't respond. Text messages appears to be sent but never delivered to them without me even knowing . I don't receive pics from friends at times when even sending them back and forth in the same room so I know for facts I'm not getting there pics. Ever even later down the road they never come even they tried multiple times. So frustrating. I uninstalled several times and reinstal	bug report
love it...til the update...now it asks me after EVERY CALL how was it.. it's very annoying	bug report
This is a pretty good app, I love Discord and all my friends on it. I have a good community on here, too! There's just one issue, and that's when I have my dark mode on, which is where the screen is black, not grey. When I have this mode on, it sometimes glitches and causes it to go back to grey and have one part black. It'd be nice if this was fixed.	bug report
The decision to remove support for SMS and MMS messages forces me to uninstall. Signal was the BEST app that had unified both instant messaging w/ 2-way encryption and standard SMS/MMS. Now it's just another encrypted messaging app. All my friends and family will stop using it since switching between apps to message certain people is a hassle. I'll have nobody to talk to on the app and I'll uninstall. If developers reverse their decision, I'd want to return but I wouldn't have anyone to talk to.	bug report

New update is horrible. Everything has curved edges in an attempt to look modern but it just ends up looking annoying and fat, the new midnight color is too dark, the way to access DMs is very annoying now and I really liked being able to see a list of people online in the server by swiping to the side, which is now replaced by clicking on the channel (really inconvenient). The way to reply to messages is super annoying. Overall this new update is just awful. Give us an option to revert back.	feature request

Skype is amazing! It's SO easy to use! I haven't had any problems with it. If you use Google's software, or Slack or Zoom, it's normal to have lots of glitches and other problems. But Skype always works - it's incredibly reliable. If you need a high quality, reliable app, for calling or texting, use Skype!	irrelevant information
Hello baby	irrelevant information
This app used to be amazing. But they got big. Got greedy. Let a fool from another greedy company into their staff. And it has gone so far downhill. They are losing the trust of their userbase. They push out unwanted barely functional updates that ruin the user experience. They don't deserve 1 star. I do not recommend using this app right now. You are genuinely better using a hellsite like Reddit than Discord anymore. You used to be great, Discord. But you disappointed us all.	irrelevant information

Very quickly becoming the worst app I have for functionality. It's great on the computer but the mobile app constantly bugs out and doesn't properly show channels, messages, or anything. Nothing but a full restart of my phone will fix it as uninstalling and reinstalling is ridiculous. Decision makers need to devote more dev time to functionality and bug fixing instead of those activities that are largely unused.	bug report

I like the app, but I have to rate one star for one simple reason. You can only send 30 second videos. My associates and I are running a skate team, where they need a one minute skate video to be put on Instagram to be approved. It would be much more efficient if we could review each video all at once instead of in 2 parts. If you guys up it to at least a minute, I'll rate 5 stars.	feature request
I really love how detailed channels can be and have been a user of discord for *years*. But with this most recent update; there has been so many bugs that make it really frustrating to use the mobile app. It freezes on chats, sometimes when i send a message i have to delete the message i just sent to be able to send another, and other times it just wont let me type at all.

After the new update the mobile app became practically unusablem The new, high contrast background is making the text extremely hard to read; and there is no option to go back to the previous shade which was much better. Not only that but the app lags a lot while switching from dms to servers. Additionally there is a problem with sending, displaying and viewing images. Finally, the pins became really hard to access and find as images were removed. Search function is broken too...	bug report

The new mobile update is horrible. Stop changing things that don't need to be changed. Everyone was used to the last UI change so why update it again? I can't name a single good change with this new version. Swiping left to reply to a message sucks because now you have to click the top of a server to see who's online. The message tab is ugly. I don't want to see what other people in random servers that I'm not friends with are doing. Everyone involved in this update should feel ashamed.	feature request

I don't exactly know what happened, but months ago there was an update to this app, which just completely destroyed it's stability.

PLEASE IMPROVE UX: create a "select multiple/all" for hiding chats, or let us let us delete them permanently. Either give us control over who we keep as "contacts" or dispense with it altogether. *.*.* No way to delete conversations or control/delete contacts is a deal breaker. Each new device install means another couple hours navigating a positively infuriating FOUR CLICK PROCESS to hide over a hundred old chats from years ago, or else new and important messages get buried and overlooked. My contact list is utterly useless and contains THOUSANDS of people I don't know and have never met thanks to large class chats at university.	feature request

Great app, soon to be useless because of the idiotic decision to remove SMS support. Only 5 people I know use signal, with the rest I communicate through SMS. Seems to me like the developers live in a region, where SMS isn't much used and they made the assumption, that that is the way for all the rest of us. Will probably uninstall once they kill SMS.	feature request

Notification chime is way too loud. The pop out Launchpad navigator is impossible to use. There is no control that works. It's always interfering with things. Especially now that swipe from the right edge is the reply function. Also the ability to search for a server by name is gone so it's terrible. I'm part of a lot of servers and I know them by name but not by icon. Because that's always changing. Why can't I just do that simply...	bug report
They are ruining this app. I used to love it, and would have given it a 5 star review. Now, you can't use capital letters in your user name, causing names to no longer be unique and fun. It's even worse for MY user name because my username REQUIRES capital letters for it to work right. Whats worse, is that if you don't change your user name, they will force it. If discord doesn't stop, I will delete it and tell everyone I can to delete it as well. I am VERY disappointed with this new update.	bug report
They are taking money out of my account and do not know what they're doing it's criminal what they're doing you can't even call them to say. I have to go to my bank and call it to stop $14 out of my bank account that I need every month I'm a senior and this is rape this is clinical rape cuz you can't call them the stuff they purposely did not put a phone number cuz you cannot stop them	bug report

Could be better. Yes you need WiFi, but you can pay for data. This app could have better quality but it's a great app. Unfortunately, ads occur very often which is annoying. The only bad thing is that the app sells your number to telemarketers so I get called every hour or so by a number that won't answer back or that tell me things like "your car loan is about to expire john" CONSTANTLY has bugs that are usually fixed within the month most of the time.	bug report

It was great and all until ACK! there were scammers calling me every 3 minutes!

The desktop verison of Discord is fantastic. However the mobile app's recent update has been a massive downgrade in quality. Everything is more disjointed and disconnected than ever before, navigating the UI is not a good experience. The darkmode color was changed snd is now nauseating to look at.

it's my second favorite app for free calling and texting. Second favorite because it's not customizable and not cute. Like I can't change the colors or appearance. I can't place a wallpaper behind a conversation. No dark theme. Stuff like that. And I have to watch videos to get minutes for calling. it's the same video over and over. it's easy to do but kind of annoying. not a huge deal though to me. I text mostly anyway.	feature request
its okay. there's a stupid limit on the amount of mb you can send for a video or photo. i recently started getting a new problem where now, every video i send goes in bad quality and doesn't look good. please fix this, and the annoying limit of the videos and photos. ive come back to edit; i was just about to watch a video my friend sent but it now won't even play the video. please actually fix these stupid issues that people shouldnt even have to worry about.	bug report

My app won't open. Keeps crashing and when it did open it wouldnt notify me if I got a text, I have to keep refreshing the app	bug report
Updating my review: It's now year 3 with Signal and the application is starting to take up storage. I hope they can introduce more storage management features like adding more options to the "keep messages" for instance I would like to keep all messages forever but automatically delete media that are older than one year or six months. Also we still don't have pinned messages. Something you would think is a basic modern messaging feature still lacking. Everything else about the app is great.	feature request
It keeps crashing for 5-15 seconds after launching.. Tried clearing cache.. *edit Just reinstall the app. This should work.	bug report

Pretty good WiFi calling. Always use this WiFi text & call app vs ALL others when my regular phone # is out of order. I absolutely hate ads , but I can deal with them to have some sort of contact when other phone is unavailable and I'm near WiFi. Definitely, recommend as the go to WiFi text/call app.	feature request

The new UI is in one word: a bloody disaster. It's hard to navigate, wasn't even needed in the first place and now, worse of all; you removed the one button to go hack to the old UI. By this point, I am convinced that pissing off the community was an intentional move.	feature request

Doesn't work. Asked me to upgrade to get verification codes and after I paid money and set it up, the codes don't come. Do not use this app!! Steals your money!!!	bug report
The new UI sucks and is much more cluttered in my opinion. You can see less channels at a time and I personally don't like the new tab to separate messages from the servers. The old design was much better, this change was useless and worse and doesn't even work. You can't see your pinned messages when you click to the tab, they just don't show up. Even if you pinned the message a second ago. Links or media also does not show up. It wasn't broken before, why "fix" it?	feature request
I mean it seems like it has potential but it doesn't let you text new numbers unless it's part of your contact list. I don't have a phone right now. I'm using a tablet which linka to contacts I had stored in Google. Google didn't save all the contacts as it should and now I can't reach out to those contacts since this app only allows you to text current contacts. Defeats my purpose of dowloading it. You should mention that in your description üòí	bug report
I absolutely hate the new UI swiping from the right is reply and not the regular users in channel and the monstrosity that right swipe brings up.

Massive L with removing SMS support, it no longer has a way to seamlessly start using the ecosystem, relegating it to the likes of telegram and other IM apps.

Everything is great except for the profile picture. it's awful. It has 2 options of editing, which is fine, but it automatically "suggests" what your pfp should look like.

A mostly good app but regardless of their updates . If you send more than 10 pictures within a minute it blocks texts for nearly 13 hours . I'm beginning to think it would do this every time .

I have had this app for a few year and I have been using verification codes ever since when I tried a verification code it didn't work it says I need to upgrade my account and I need a new version something like that even though I have been using codes for a long time now	bug report
We cant get code in iran please fix it	bug report
i enjoy useing your app, but it seem to freeze up and shut apps, down. sometimes i uninstall then reinstall the textnow app, to get it work again. overall when the textnow app, is working it works great.	bug report

Its good to send a text but wen I try to call someone I keep getting the whoops message nd I have a lot of minutes plz fix this	bug report

Call quality could be better and ffs stop with the popups WHILE i'm typing. I'm halfway through a message to my boss and i end up on google play or some website. Not cool	bug report
I have just two problems. First, the login process. Every time I try to login to my account, it says email or password incorrect while my every detail is neatly written, I always have to say forgt password twice before I can regain access of my account. This is really frustrating and I need a way to get ahold of my previous account. Secondly, the mojis, they look like nothing, they come out big which is good but their graphics are very far from where we know. I not great concept. If not great ap	bug report
It would be nice to be able to manage chats by deleting what has already been read or at least the option to do so	feature request
Allways great!!	irrelevant information
I use this for work. It's come in handy since the powers that be don't want us gathered for informational meetings/general work info. So this is a perfect solution for Covid-19. We get the pertinent info without being at risk, real social distance. The only downside I've experienced is i didn't wanna download to take up more space on my phone, so the text messages i recieved were perfect. Since i don't chat i was deactivated and had to download. A user guide would help us less tech savy folks.	irrelevant information
Why can't I update the app on my phone and when I uninstall it won't downloaded again	bug report
It's OK but can you like  make different accounts wahn you use different gamil but same password please	feature request

slow to send & receive messages. I have tried on multiple Wi-Fi so it's not just my house. The other thing I don't like is the ad that goes right over the text box & you press close & it don't leave so fast to see what your typing.	bug report
It sucks can only change number 2 time's dumb	bug report
Its easy to use and easy to get minutes	irrelevant information
Voice message does not play on any mobile device. I logged in my Skype account many devic e.. still same issue	bug report
Tried to download four five times always ends up the same way. leaving me hanging I don't care how good it is if you can't download it and use it it's worth nothing to anyone......	bug report
Dropped my internet connection and no matter what I do will not let me back on	bug report
I love the service.	irrelevant information
Very easy to use.i don't have enough friends using this to give an aceret opinion on it's value in communication. The few people I use it with are satisfied with its function as a message carrier. It fits my needs for talking with others using this app.I have not used it that way.	irrelevant information
Great for emergency situations and free with less ads than any ive found so far.	irrelevant information
I wish you'd add an edit function. Also, I HATE HATE HATE that my pinky way too communicate with you is through email. I have had problems and have not been able till contact you to fix them. If I had another choice out there besides groupme I'd surely try it.	feature request
A great app .. But you make so you can recieve codes if you locked out of accounts for any reason .. You cant receive them on your textnow app .. Only if you pay for it.. And if its your primary number ..then it maks it hard to get a code .	feature request
first off- the notifications come in late for texts and calls. 2nd- the group chat messenges come in scrambled up and out of order, which makes things confusing	bug report

Got a new number and it will NOT let me change it on my account I've even tried to go to the website I can not update the number so it won't ever leave me logged in we use it for work updates so I miss the time line a lot of the time	bug report
It's good for texting but when it comes to the non stop ads that you can't click off of its horrible. I won't even touch the ad and it automatically downloads things on my phone. Whatever ad pops up that's now downloaded on my phone and I'm deleting a new app every time I use it it's absolutely exhausting.	bug report
I no longer would rate 5 stars because they are removing sms support. If youre tech savvy enough to use this, you're tech savvy enough to know sms isn't secure and who is using it.	feature request
6/2023: I've had a few months of a weird glitch where no notifications come through unless I manually open the app. It's happening on all three separate accounts. Very frustrating. There doesn't seem to be an update to fix the issue? Prior review: So far this has been great. The things I text about don't pop up as advertisements on my phone later! üòç	bug report

The new update is terrible, its annoying to navigate, can't swipe left in servers and chats to see the people in the server, I don't need a quick swipe action to reply to people l, i would rather be able to swipe left in chats to see the people in the chats/server. I hate having chats in a separate tab, it glitches out constantly	feature request

I used it before it was a good app but now it makes me buy things to see what they send me so I don't know if I like it as much	irrelevant information
Calls drop, some calls can't connect, sometimes you can't even use the app.	bug report
It is adding txt to every message I send. FROM YOUR FRIEND OH DONNY BOY. very annoying.	bug report

I would normally give this app 5 star rating but for the last 2 days it's not been responding.	bug report
I wish they could add some sort of a safety feature. This would make the kids that are younger safer to be on discord. If they could do something like this it would be amazing.	feature request
I used to love this app ! It was perfect while I didn't have service on my phone . I downloaded it yesterday && it only shows me my messages when I open the app .

Thanks again.. Angel	bug report
Very well constructed	irrelevant information
Keeps telling me I have to turn on native text messaging in order to keep texting from it, but my bff (who introduced the app to me) told me that hers isn't doing that. It also won't let me send pics without native text messaging being turned on. IF I WAS YOU, I WOULDNT DOWNLOAD IT. ITS NOT WORTH IT.	bug report
The negative points I see in Skype is that : 1. It doesn't have SELECT ALL and DELETE OPTION for messages .   2. It's not opening someone's profile pic to show it bigger	feature request

there is a guy who wrote on 3\30\19 that said he "sleeps with his gf on Skype" hahahahahahahaha. is that the definition of being whipped or what? i guess it could just be co dependency but i think that's still an issue too! lolz the stuff you hear these days just keeps getting funnier all time. thanks for the laughs!!!	irrelevant information

FREKAING SCARES ME WHEN CALLNG DOESNT LET ME TEXT NOR CALL	bug report
Great when it wants to work but horrible when it does not.	bug report
Worked great prior to the most recent update. Lots of bugs related to visual elements not displaying properly such as disappearing messages, changing servers and rooms not rendering the newly chosen room and or server, etc. Closing or swiping away the app fixes it for some time, but then it breaks again. New UI takes more swipes and taps to switch between a server and a DM, but does seem more intuitive. Muscle memory will take time. Pixel 8 Pro, fully up to date.	bug report
Not working with Bluetooth headset	bug report
i used to like it and already use it and subscribed since 2018, but now it become a scam app, it only looking for more money, I received and voicemail for activation, and only allow me to hear the first number, and then asked me to pay again to hear or enscript the rest while I already paid and subscribed to annually.	bug report

I love Discord in general so app is no exception. Edit: I absolutely hate the new update. There is so much wrong with it. I hate it that I don't see the list of members when I swipe left. Replying with swiping is so inconvenient for me, I still use just along press. Separating servers and messaging is annoying too, but I guess it's something I can get used to. Themes are cool though.	feature request
Half the times calls dont come through! Randomly get a voicemail notification but no ring. So annoying!!	bug report

I'm happy to say calls are sounding good again, loud and clear, and the SIM has been working without the random interruptions of the past. Elastic calls are still troubling slow, when transitioning between WiFi and cell, but at least the calls are not dropping, which is a huge improvement. Elastic calls have worked faster in the past.

Will not answer phone calls for the last 2 months. Hitting "answer" just lets it continue ringing until voice mail picks up.

It's great for texting but I don't dig the whole having to have minutes to call because there are other apps that you can call and text for free. And you have a better connection for whatever reason. Like I have text free and text now and I can stand in the same spot right next to the WiFi router and have better call connection with text now than I do with this here text free.

App works, as it always has. I get that ads are income needed to operate the app, but those are in app and not my issue. What I don't understand is why we need ads in lockscreen now. I've used this app for over a decade. This is my first and only complaint. 5 stars otherwise.	feature request

New updated UI is horrendous, missing out a lot of the benefits of the old UI. Major red flag for the Highlight push notifications sending weird and creepy simplifications of other people's texts and activities.

There was genuinely no need for an entire UI change. Everything beforehand was entierly funtional, easier to navigate, and had cohesion with other platforms. Every person I've seen talk about the most recent update (as of 1/14/2024, when I'm writing this) has had nothing stellar to say about it. The change of location for DMs is my biggest gripe as it's pointless and makes it harder to navigate. If all of my friends weren't on Discord I would uninstall.	feature request

You can't scroll down while editing your profile anymore, and it's very annoying. Edit: So there's a certain spot towards the bottom that allows you to scroll down, otherwise it just freezes. (And scrolling up is impossible too). It'll be 5 stars when this issue ever gets fixed.	bug report
I still hate that Signal dumped support for SMS. It was an elitist and uncreative move.	feature request
At first, Discord was a great application. Then the updates started. With every single update, the app got worse and worse. Wouldn't connect right, wouldn't load messages right, would send messages twice, took forever to load... They made everyone make usernames instead of the #0000 which... I hate. Alot. And finally, this latest update. They completely remodeled the app. It looks horrible and functions less. There are so many problems with it. The desktop version is okay. The mobile? Trash.	bug report

Skype is very common however old skype was better sound quality. we cannot change the sound of notification that's why it is very hard to hear the sound and sometime I missed very important messages.	bug report
Works great! The only complaint is the ads.. for the price, it is definitely worth it to have a phone number that can be used anywhere, not just where Wi-Fi is available. The free version has to have Wi-Fi to use but for a small very acceptable fee, you can use it anywhere and it gives you mobile data plan! This is second to none for a app to use besides my main phone service carrier. I rely on this if my service laps and cancels due to non-payment. All around great app and premium is ad free..	feature request

Updated : notifications issue. I am disappointed with the new UI. I have found it extremely difficult to use with many steps than the old UI. I am only continuing to use the app as it's the only way to communicate with certain friends. Very disappointed.

The app has been great in the past and concept-wise it's useful. But it's very glitchy. Avatars don't update. I cannot see or tag all members in a group chat. Chats disappear sometimes. It's really a pain. Please fix.	bug report
Seems to be iffy some days with connection. I get notification of a missed call when I'm on the app nor will it ring sometimes. Sometimes I press the answer button and nothing happens and the only way to fix this is to decline the call and try again. Both party's connection is not an issue. So it puzzles me why Skype keeps messing up now about 50% of the time.	bug report
It has been ok but my messages don't always go through and the phone dosent always go through and sound muffled sometimes	bug report
Good app but it has issues letting me make phone calls or at least leaving a message. it also hasn't been letting me answer phone calls.	bug report

I am experiencing this issue for a long time, and it only happens in the mobile version i never expeirenced this issue on my laptop, so the issue is that when i try to go to the members tab, discord just starts glitching and randonly throws me into the members rab several times and it doesnt stops until i close and reopen the app, thus glitch is really annoying so please fix it real soon	bug report

good app to use on chrome browser but if ur downloading the app and ur logging in when u press the authentication with the security key it like wont even do anything it closes the app id like this to be fixed because id rather have it in my taskbar rather than in my chrome.	bug report

I like community and server possibilities. However, from mobile usijg bluetooth heapdones is almost impossible since version 25. They removed Call communication mode and i had to update app to newer version only because of compatibility. Also, app is laggy. I find smooth transitions useless, only making lags. Would be nice if can be turned off. Now i use discord occasionaly for reading messages. For other purposes including voice chat quite its annoying on mobile.	feature request
Putting ads is useless. I just close the app and re open it. It's alot quicker.	bug report
I really like the app it's really useful to me and my friends and i can mostly make new friends! But I do have some problems with some of the lag but yet doesn't always happen. So yet it's still fun because of the nitro and I mostly use stickers to express myself and yet it's super useful! This is an update, I've been having problems recently in getting into the app but it keeps kicking me out I'm not sure what's causing it.	feature request
The new update clearly wasn't bug tested well enough. I don't mind the new appearance, but at least make sure everything doesn't break after a little usage. This is not asking for support, just condemning a bad update.	bug report

As far as I've experienced (on mobile), it's actually quite an alright update. The layout changed a bit but not too much till you can't recognise it. [ However I would prefer the old search system rather than this new one, this new one is indeed refreshing but I can't seem to find the From, Files, Sound, etc which is much more efficient ]	feature request
The app was good but then they altered the programming to copy peoples contact information. Its now a scam app	bug report

OLD: Discord is great for connecting with friends. This mobile app redesign, however, is atrocious and has completely ruined my enjoyment of the app. Please change it back. UPDATE: discord has reverted most of the awful changes they did when I originally wrote this review. I now think the mobile app is good again.	feature request
Notifications are not reliable. Often they are half a day to a day delayed. Other messaging apps do not have the same issue so battery optimization of Pie is not the problem.	bug report

Honestly it's an ok app, but for some reason it freezes up your phone	bug report
This communication app seems to be the best of the ones available. The only problems I've had are not being able to send a picture with a text message and the sim card they offer (on T-Mobile) doesn't work for me. No bars usually; at the most, one bar. Either way, I can't do anything. On the bright side, phones calls are usually very clear and texting just text works well.	bug report
I can't create an account, after doing verifying I'm not a robot it still refers me back. This is a total rubbish	bug report
Truly impressed by the dev's efforts to worsen this program at every turn. Being barely accessible to VI people wasn't enough, so they changed usernames to be far easier to be spoofed by spambots. Then they added AI without warning. Now this. Impressive! They'll catched up to Tw- sorry, ""X"" by 2024, at this rate.	irrelevant information
use it at all. Amazed by the major improvement in phone performance after	irrelevant information
It works great while you're on wifi, as its supposed to. Haven't had any issues with it yet	irrelevant information
Tha idea of this app is great... I use this app with Wi-Fi when my phone doesnt get signal at home. It works ok but in order for me to see tht I have a text I have to open tha app and refresh it, it doesn't automatically notify me when I have a text. If this was fixed I would rate 5 stars.	feature request
Okay. So Discord WAS good. It let us create communities and had amazing flexibility in what kind of servers and activities we could do But their recent "improvement" update instantly put me off (for mobile.) It takes no consideration for accessibility, and even removed USEFUL functions. Let's just say I'm only using it right now to communicate with my friends, otherwise I'd dip. I might change my review if they realize that their users shouldn't have to "get used to" something we never wanted.	feature request

Been using the mobile app on Android for five years. I don't mind the new UI, except that the app has become incredibly unstable since. Not once had a single problem with the app, but now channels will update with the same chat you were on on a previous channel, app is slower to load, messages won't load, after switching channels sometimes can't hard press a message to see options and can't swipe left to reply. Messages will be sent to a previous channel you were in. It's a terrible mess now.	bug report

Miserable to use, which is a shame, because it was so very functional years ago. Why can't I search in messages? There is no easy way to search or see anything that wasn't in the last couple of days.

It's a great app overall.

Good. Using it at the time of lockdown	irrelevant information
It was great until they removed SMS, now it's just a worse Whatsapp. Your SMS has to be handled by an app that will mine them for money, you have to know if someone has Signal to message them, and you have to juggle multiple apps. Not worth it, there are equal apps for encryption that more people have.	feature request

A great app that can be used as a drop-in replacement for most other apps. It offers great security when messaging someone else with the app and falls back to unsecure messages when the recipient doesn't use the app. Edit: Signal will no longer support SMS messages.

It forces you to relink in various scenarios such as being gone for a week and upon returning home and opening the app with your home WiFi it gives you no choice but to relink... and you lose all you previous converstions. It may be by design but is utterly unacceptable. Signal has a challenge, give users an option to avoid losing everything!!!	bug report
Had this app for years, now the ads finally ruined it.	bug report
Thank you app for steering my 14yo directly into porn Im devistated, and our family is crushed. The clickable aps are Porn!!!!!!

Parent dont get this app for your child to save a couple bucks. Pay for a phone service w texting. Extremly, hurt.	bug report
The ad's often make a nuisance of themselves, and on a tablet it can be hard to answer calls bc of a glitch that makes my tablet lag until I either eventually regain control or the app crashes. Otherwise, this used to be a pretty solid app.. While homeless and using a wifi (no contract/carrier, so no service besides public wifi) phone this app was a HUGE help with staying in touch with family/children, as well as securing a job and pulling myself up out of the hole I had dug.	bug report
Loved it so much	irrelevant information
There is not a better end to end encrypted messaging app available. I used this for several years, and even after the announcement that SMS support is going away, I continued to use it until the end. Now that it seems that they are continuing down this path, I will be deleting it and I cannot recommend it any more. Their reasoning for depreciating SMS is quite weak, and as will be clear from anyone who reads recent reviews it won't pan out well for signal with the decision they're making.	irrelevant information
It's just horrible everytime it kicks you out for no apparent reason to. Then you try to sign in. Oh wait! It says there's a problem. You go fix it. You come back. Says there's still a problem. These new modifications before the old ones are terrible.	bug report

I no longer can recommend this to my non tech friends as a viable solution for sending secured messages as they're not going to be willing to install an app with a smaller penetration into the market like WhatsApp or Telegram without the killer feature of being able to also use that app to consolidate secure messages and SMS.

All in all, this app has been pretty good. They've had a few hiccups, which they have fixed. But this morning, I see that unencrypted sms messaging will no longer be supported. I have zero interest in using a secondary messaging app for the people that do not use Signal.. as if I'm now supposed to pressure them into getting the app. Such a poor decision on their part, and it turns me off from Signal.	feature request

When I changed phone numbers, someone got my old number. When they used that number to sign up for a GroupMe account, it overwrote the information on my account, prompting several "your information has been changed" emails to which I could not reply to correct the issue.

2022 Update: just learned that Signal will soon no longer work with SMS texting and will only work with internal messages like Telegram and the rest. This defeats the purpose of using it to preserve privacy, and looks like just a way to increase the user base. Cancelled my recurring monthly subscription and unless they can adequately explain why, I'll soon be looking for a new texting app. Very disappointing.	feature request

I gave the new UI a try for the past month and find it unappealing. Many actions require more effort to perform. Ie.

Free text app needs money to receive text. Absolutely covered in ads. This app didn't used to be like that. Another corporation consumed with greed.	feature request
Calls are wonderful but the app as a whole is extremely laggy which is getting on my nerves and it sometimes can have extremely Loud static and echos	bug report

A good, strong alternative to FB or WhatsApp. Privacy and Security is top quality. A good app for everyone who values their personal information and doesn't want it shared or sold on. Share it with your friends.	irrelevant information

The old ui system and interface was better for mobile, this new one is laggy, difficult to handle and boring, the old one was easy and could do multiple task like checking who dmed you without closing the server, and not laggy also, it was easier you guys should bring back old discord.	feature request
Works really well, updates me really often, the only downside was trying to get set up and invited to my group was super difficult.	feature request

My Discord app is not updating for a reason, I'm on ( Galaxy Tab S6 Lite ) and I tried to update the discord, but somehow, nothing changed. I hope discord reply to me.	bug report
Wouldn't transfer messages from native text app. Tech support said I missed a prompt that only ever appears once then its impossible to transfer all your existing messages. There was no prompt.	bug report
You know, why we have to "buy" minutes, to make even local calls, is beyond me. Other's like your service, do not. So, like before, I uninstalled, and I'll never use TextFree again.  It's very disappointing that you guys claim "Free calling" when it's only free for incoming and calls to other TextFree accounts. Sorry, but that is indeed, false advertising.	irrelevant information
The app works well and it's cool I can text my folks in other countries but I get a bunch of notifications saying I was just called by some random number and it's so freaking annoying ~!!! Does anyone run into the same problem?	bug report
Ui update is god awful, how in the hell do you go from something that's decent but worked to something completely different that only works after you close app 2-7 times, or begins to have issues if you watched youtube in full screen, closed app then switch to discord? I don't understand the need to change for the sake of change. Hell even the nitro stuff requires you to log in on PC, so what's the point of showing the options if you can't have access on IOS and Android?	bug report
Buggy on Poco X3 NFC with miui v14 Send button often gone, need to restart apps often before it comes back. Very inconvenient to reply chat if the send button is gone.	bug report
I love this app, but it doesn't notify me about messages or calls. I dont know if its my phone,(even though notifications work with other apps)but its a serious problem and its really irritating.	bug report
Yell I.berly getting this App so I.hope it works	irrelevant information
what is problem from 5 days any id are not sign up	bug report
Cool for enjoyable conversation across spaces, especially when the Internet is good. Not suitable for poor Internet connection	irrelevant information
Actual garbage. Use to work great. Now it won't even call out. Just says connecting. Or when someone calls you, you hear them but when you speak its completely mute. And its not a hardware issue because calling on other apps works just fine. Actual garbage get your stuff together text now.	bug report
The new update is horrible. Searching in server, looking at pins that were once full text and helped my players know what to do/where to go is now useless. Muscle memory keeps swiping and tapping things that have completely changed the way they work so when I try to swipe for pins, who's online, search, etc I reply to a post instead. Have to access messages differently. Why would you change the whole scope of how your app works? Especially when so many told you we didn't like it the first time?	feature request
Android keyboard gif integration has been broken for some time now. GroupMe is changing the gif into a still picture. This doesn't happen in other apps, and it's affecting multiple Android users in our group chat on GroupMe.	bug report

How are you just gonna ruin your whole app by making it so I can't text non-signal users any more? The only reason I even kept this app was so I wouldn't lose all my text threads but now it's not even worth it anymore. What a crock. Y'all failed.	feature request
Have to update my review after version 211.15 - "Stable" update. Appreciate your update but this version is very much unusable and I am tired of trying to just ignore it.	bug report
I am not a fan. I got banned for "violating" their terms of service. I cannot get back on my number at all. When I did have it it was good for texting but I got banned for no reason.	bug report

Moderation sucks but overall well made.	irrelevant information
This app sucks. Freezes up 90% of the time. Takes forever to load up. The only way I can shut the notification music off when someone texts or calls me is by restarting my phone. It interferes with other texting apps. Its a real aggravating app to deal with. Now I understand why its free. I have done spent $200 dollars on two more phones because I got so aggravated and smashed them because of this app. I tried re-downloading it several times and nothing works. Junk. I highly recommend you dont us	bug report
Awesome app to communicate with each other as a group üòä	irrelevant information
It .. OK. Recently text sound notifications have stopped coming thru no mater what I change in the settings. Call quality is sub par but passable.. sometimes. It's just.. OK	bug report
Unfortunately getting people to converse on anything but whatsapp is very tricky... I love the app, having it instead of Googles default sms provider is perfect. Due to not enough people I know on signal (and sometimes they don't get notifications) I don't think without sms support I will make any use of it. Hope they decide to reconsider, or come up with a new cool idea as I support anything not meta related.	feature request
They took my number even though I had just used it and it's still available but they won't allow me to get it back smh	bug report

Good group msg app, but can be hard to pre-read messages due to small text box when entering a message, so you will need to type in another notes app and copy paste the message if you want to pre read.	feature request

Consider to leave after SMS has been removed. Might only keep on, because some family members are on it	feature request
The best WhatsApp alternative. The software is fantastic, however gifs and stickers from the Google keyboard don't always paste in the chat, saying signal doesn't support stickers. Also, the thumbnail of the image I copied does not always appear in the conversation section. It would be fantastic if there was a way to edit the chats. Also, the stickers are limited, so it would be great if it could accommodate external stickers.	feature request
As long my account Don't get verified like i need the phone number im good i just hate it that i have to do it in my different account	feature request
New update is horrible and every subsequent update fixes bugs for about a day, and then they come back. Getting rid of the swipe controls was stupid. The layout is stupid and unintuitive. All these canned message responses to reviews tells me that no one is actually reading anything or taking in feedback. I've never seen a company go to such lengths to destroy something so many people use and refuse to revert the changes after widespread outcry. Sad!	feature request
Keeping our group in touch. Thanks!!	irrelevant information
Never rings the first time somone calls me	bug report
I myself have used this app for years now. I have to say it's really good. The only thing is the new update is terrible in my opinion. It's harder to navigate and everytime I click a new text channel, it scrolls up into earlier messages making me have to scroll all the way down again. But overall a really good app and I have recommended to friends.	feature request

App has a very bad UX, when I'm in call, I have to tap the screen to see the menu for microphone mute and other stuff but problem is, it's not showing immediately or sometimes never. I tapped and tapped but nothing happened. Please you don't have to hide those options. Make it visible for all the time. That way user can take immediate action whenever want.	feature request

The app isnt letting me know when i get important messages and its messing with my work. My notifications are on and everything, thats not the problem theyre just not letting me know, i have to physically go onto the app and check to see if I have any messages, but by then its too late.	bug report
It used to work perfectly fine & had no lagging or notification or incoming message ringing issues. Now that I subsequently had to reset my phone and reinstall now these issues arose. I completed a help desk report and the issues aren't fixed and I'm sure they don't plan on fixing anytime soon. They send mediocre suggestions on how to "maybe" fix. It's basically a bug issue on pinger's side of the table. These issues occurred on my Huawei prisim 2. I uninstalled and suggest you find a better messaging app.	bug report
This app used to be great and I would get my notifications if I got a message now I won't get a notification at all that I have a message and I am supposed to I have it set up for me to get notifications for this app and I don't anymore I'm not sure what's going on with the app but this is very disappointing	bug report

I proudly give it a two-star review. Not only because the spam calls but also when I try to call somebody the volume goes blank like there is no sound when it is supposed to be ringing. It only works sometimes and that is like 5% of the time!	bug report
Needs individual contact ringtones and the ability to use my phone's sms plan I have no problem paying for Skype calls but I get sms free even on a budget plan.	feature request
I had very few technical issues with the app and it came in very handy when I was living in an area where I could not get cell phone sevice. But I purchased a recurring subscription for the app that I no longer need. I have looked everywhere and cannot find a way to cancel.	feature request
There is something wrong Samsung Galaxy devices. I have Samsung Galaxy A54. Every time I use the voice message feature, my voice sounded so low, I have to increase my phone volume to around 80% to 95% just to hear the preview or the result. I'm afraid some people even my fans on my Discord server needed to do the same by increasing their phone volumes that much. It would be so annoying and irritating for them.	bug report

Texting is okay but when you try to make a phone call with the other person says they can't hear you too much static and going in and out so that's why I'm only going to give it one star that's just for texting if you could fix the phone quality I'll give it a higher rating	bug report

WiFi quality degrades over time...on each WiFi connection...starts as Excellent the decrements to Poor without movement	bug report
oftentimes UI lays out in a weird way and some buttons get stuck outside of the screen. I have to restart the app to fix it every time which is annoying	bug report
Skype has very good facility and it's flow is also smooth without any hindrance. I have always used it confidently. It needs add one facility, for example when any call comes, it should message that the device is busy, because sometimes we are discussing some important issue or do not want any disturbance at that time. Now this facility is not available so it troubles the discussion and if we pic the call the discussion will be disconnected. Besides audio channel also need separate track.	feature request
Good but some bugs.	bug report
Since the update its become so awful to use, always have to re open it to view messages and the ui update was just beyond useless, change it back ffs.	feature request
Recent changes to the application has made me unlikely to recommend it to anyone. The UX changes are not intuitive, clunky, and difficult to navigate. The lack in parity to the desktop application and prioritization of monetization have become major turn offs, especially when other services offer similar features for free. I've down graded my application until a revision of the layout is made, or I'm forced to update. In case if the latter, I'm be uninstalling.	feature request
Suddenly BANNED for NO reason I've used this app for years with no problems. Suddenly I've been Blocked and Banned permanently. Customer support REFUSES to tell me why. I used this # for many things, and now I need to change my contact info for MANY sites.	bug report

Don't waste your time with these Jerks! I have been a paying user for Months if not Years at this point and they deleted my account WITHOUT WARNING for apperinatly violating there terms and conditions' and what's worse is they said they can not tell me what or how anything happened. NO customer support on it so I have lost EVERYTHING out of nowhere! Worse is they offer services that DO NOT WORK in Canada! LOOK ELSEWHERE for a VOIP app with Texting because these guys suck! Google remove them!	bug report
I have been using this app for years and it's great for texting. Its one of the only free texting and calling apps out there where you can contact ANYONE, as opposed to the rest of them that require you to only contact other people who ALSO have the app. The negative is phone calls...if i have an EXCELLENT wifi connection i MIGHT be able to make a call. Also I can't get my phone to notify me when a call is coming in...i only know there was a call when i get the notification that i missed it.	bug report
Great app, but run by people who don't listen to the community. Adding a new UI and forcing users to use it while also removing the (already programmed) toggle to turn it off is unacceptable and says a lot about how they value their users. Discord doesn't care and actively make poor decisions that do nothing to enhance the app, even when there is a unanimous agreement against a feature. I'm forced to use this app only because everyone else does.	feature request
Video call its svce ...bad ...	bug report
Awesome so far.	irrelevant information
Took away the sms messaging	feature request
I really liked using Discord but unfortunately I have to give it a 2 star rating based on the recent update that makes it infuriating to use. The update makes you do more extra steps than it's simple old format, I just got confused trying to figure out how to DM people and it really SHOULDN'T be that hard to literally navigate a menu and send a text. I am very unhappy with this update and even when I tuned off automatic updates, it still updated and it doesn't give me the option to downgrade.	feature request

this used to be an awesome wifi phone app. It is very dependable and has great call quality. It saved me from having to pay for phone service since having a very tight budget doesn't allow for it. I use it as my main phoneline, and it's associated with all of my major accounts in real life. But now, it says that I have to pay $5 per month JUST to receive a verification code if I need one. How is that fair? Obviously if I am using a free wifi based call/text app, I cannot afford the EXTRA fees!	feature request
Never used it, yet.	irrelevant information
GUYS PLEASE FIX THE BUGS, IM NOT ABLE TO SEND A 2 MIN VIDEO IN THE CHAT.	bug report
This is useful for traveling if you're not keeping your regular number. $9+ per week for verification codes is EXPENSIVE. I can get a cheaper phone plan with data. Having different tiers and doing monthly and yearly would be beneficial.	feature request
Its awesome aside from rare crashing its simply great and i can connect with so many friends, new update but for some people no matter how good your data is it wont connect to discord	bug report
Not going to update from now on until it allows me. Horrible new ui changes on the app as far as looks and accessibility goes. If I wanted to use Messenger, I'd use Messenger.

Be warned: If you change your pin, you will lose access to anything that's attached to your account forever, be it chat histories, stickers, or your bio. You can't even restore a backup you made prior to this! Not that the app ever tells you that explicitly, I had to find out the hard way. So make absolutely sure you never forget or change your pin or everything will be lost! I genetally prefer messaging apps that value their user experience a bit more, hence the one star review.	feature request

THEY DELETED MY LAST REVIEW. this app sucks. It's slow, has to many adds. And worst of all it will not let me answer calls. Worst phone app ever. It used to work fine, then 2022 came.	bug report

Great for group activity organization	irrelevant information
The app is bacically a necessity when it comes to talking to your friends or joining a gaming group call, so I can't really rate it lower than I did. However, there are many issuses I have experienced these past weeks (I had to manually update the app) that have never occured prior to updating the app. One of these issuses makes voice calls essentially useless, claiming that the app is still "connecting" to the call. Looked for a way to solve this issue, but the app has less settings than pc.	bug report
Very helpful and I'm very happy with it.	irrelevant information
My app won't load new messages. Only on the browser version.	bug report

Since the update about a week ago, the app is significantly worse.

This app is not letting me send or receive picture messages and I just found out my bf has a BIG bill because my number is apparently a Louisiana phone number. NOT COOL! I also found out my text-free number is a SPAM NUMBER?!?!? This better not be a virus app! Plz get back to me ASAP!	bug report

i must say, this new update, I'm pretty impressed with new UI looks, kinda remind me with the UI that i likely use. I'm still not used to it, when typing message, and I can't feel vibration when holding(message/pict/link), or maybe it need some improvement.	feature request

Can't add people to a group call if they aren't previously in the group. Group call doesn't give a ring. It only gives a notification that goes unnoticed as any other notification.

After the newest update, every time I open my new chat (personal chat), it doesn't immediately scroll to the new unread messages Switching between servers to private chats are also not as smooth as before since they're in two different tabs.

No longer supoorting SMS! This is a huge disappointment, I liked being able to text everyone using signal, encryption or not.

Great app for chatting in a group just don't like how buggy it is.. It freezes up a lot for me and messages have a delay when trying to send and receive. I get the notification but takes a while to pop up on the feed. other than  that,  ok app.	bug report
I have to have this app for my kids sports notifications. IT WONT EVEN LET ME SIGN UP!!! Uugghh. It's crazy. I shouldn't have to work this hard for an app. I've been trying for over a week. Even updated it. Still nothing. Just frustrated. It's a shame. My husband is having the same problem. I have an LG phone and he has a Motorilla. So, I don't think that's the issue. Whose bright idea was this anyway. I'd rather use carrier pigeon at this point!	bug report
You know what's a bit terrifying folks? When it's not advertised in giant bold print that by using an app... you consent to your screen lock being disabled and people being able to do whatever they want to almost everything on your phone. If you use this app, your phone is already the shared digital/intellectual property of the developer, it's just in your palm, dear user. Why would anyone consent to the contents/projects on an SD card or a phone to suddenly be allowed to disappear or be stolen? If my friends and family were being interacted with by an adulterated extension of myself I would consider it criminal. Lesson learned... PHONE CARD. The other text/call apps have similar complaints. If you don't have the money for a phone card then you are putting yourself at risk using these kinds of apps, for 'free'. The information age thrives off of ignorance as much as the iron age thrives off of swords. Like, develope and administrate an app like this? The motive would probably be stealing and selling information. Talk about fine print... And even if no one cares, earn credit methods don't function, I could only text. So, maybe become less suspicious or share your intentions in all these ridiculous permissions. From 5 stars and good review to this straight up real talkin'. Please keep the public informed.	irrelevant information

I'm disappointed the developers haven't updated the app for smart watch features. I would like to quick rely from my watch and read messages. Also, why can't two end users after to have the option to share and save pictures? That should be an off feature until one end disagrees. I'm give a better rating when I see these features.	feature request
Buggy and a bit laggy on the new update. Sometimes, it takes forever to connect. Laggy when switching from servers to messages. UI was a bit hard to adjust to. Fix the buggy connecting issue, I keep having to restart the app to have my messages update and sometimes that doesn't work.	bug report
Update Mar 19th: SMS support is removed and so is Signal. I stand by my original review on this. I'm in cybersecurity and the decision to remove sms is typical of amateur or power hungry security professionals. The job is about balance guys. Annoy threat actors without annoying your users enough they find a work around or leave.	feature request
Can't even send images or videos anymore since the new mobile update. It always tells me something went wrong and to retry. Even once I reload the app and try again it still doesn't work.

The app is good overall but the new mobile update is just breaking things on our end.	feature request

Company had my previous review deleted. So where to start it's an ok app... Except you have to send a text once everyday or you lose the number assigned to you and it use to be a couple weeks before that happened. They also use to have a yearly plan to lock your number in for $4.99 but now it's a monthly subscription now. I've decided to go with another app just because of how annoying it is having to text or call someone everyday just to keep my number.	bug report

The new UI update is much worse and slower than the old UI. The server tab hasn't really changed other than being slower than before and swapping between servers and user conversations is much slower and more annoying than before and even seeing who is in the servers, now you have to tap the top of the chat to even see who is in it or on. It is much slower and takes extra steps for something simple. Do not fix something that isn't broken, please.	feature request

Left a review that was apparently deleted, so here it is again. Discord mobile USED to be fantastic and do its job very well, but they've since forced an update that is horrendous. The UI/UX design is worse than before. You have less information available on each screen, and it takes more clicks to get where you want. So much information is hidden behind unnecessary clicks, unlike before, that it just feels clunky.	feature request

Edit (12/7/2023): ( * * ) Downgrading review and removing nitro subscription until horrible new update is either repaired or rolled back. New layout no longer optional. Slow, buggy.

I enjoy the app, it is less problematic than the other apps but I am only giving it 3 stars because..... it does not meet my needs. I purchased the service for the sole purpose of verification codes. I did the trouble shooting, I have adjusted all the settings along with all the google settings and nothing worked. I am keeping the app because it is pretty cool and I'm using it on a phone without service. If the developers can solve that issue, I'll gladly up the stars to 5Ô∏è‚É£	feature request

It's pretty good, but i have two complaints.  1) When I text from the app on my phone, I have to text really slow or else it freezes, the keyboard disappears, and I have to close the app. And then it loses what I was in the middle of typing.  2) So glad I can send and receive pics now without that email address...

Hi, I was wondering why discord suddenly shows connecting while I'm on a call and when I tried to uninstall it and log in again, it won't let me. It won't work both on mobile phone and laptop.

Your Skype video calls have been dropping without warning. The past two weeks I have noticed a big change in the quality of your services. I'll be talking with friends, when the video unexpectedly stops & freezes, then the call is disconnected. My friends are also having these issues. Please fix! Thanks. ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫	bug report
HATE the new layout. It's all over the place and makes getting to everything so much harder. Still a great way to keep in touch w gaming buddies. But this new layout and UI is unforgivable.	feature request
Deleted my account without me asking them to. What's that all about? They block some email providers like tutanota.	bug report
Cant seem to get free minutes. I watched 2 videos and compledted one action without being credited. I downloaded this app to text people from my tablet. Everytime I sent a text the app says my phone number expired even though I just selected one. Even if I select a new phone number it still won't let me send a text. UPDATE: I did send an email however I have not seen a response.	bug report

There should b a option to delete your account fr and every time u open the app it takes a fat min to load up ur contacts shows blac screen and the calls are crappy its sometimes hard to understand each other	bug report
The application is very slow and hangs a lot. Either the UI is very heavy or not optimized efficiently at all. I have been using Skype for the last 13-14 years or so. I remember it used to work like a charm with 512b ram single core laptopa. It feels like Microsoft is letting Skype die a slow death only to make teams mainstream. Skype has seen it's best golden days. But now it feels like a ignored lost cause. Do something Microsoft. Skype is a useful good product which needs attention.	bug report
freindly to use	irrelevant information
The app is good, but with the recent update, whenever I'm in a call, it would make my screen go black at random times. I hope this issue can be fixed.	bug report

Ever since they rolled out the new mobile update, Discord has essentially become unusable. Finding anything has basically become a multi-step process. Want to switch from a chat to a server? You now need to back out of the chat, hit the server button, THEN you can find the server. Oh, can't forget how chats will now show you old messages first! The simplicity and convience of mobile has gone down the drain with this update.	feature request

Was so happy when I first came across this app cause I am currently deployed and wanted to keep in contact with those back home. App worked good the first couple weeks and now it sucks. I have to constantly keep hitting refresh to get my messages and mist of the time I STILL don't get them till hours or days later. Please fix ASAP	bug report
I like the additional security measures they have added. It is a very stable app BUT it is still dependent on the stability of the internet connection. It keeps on reconnecting during the call.	bug report

Doesnt always show new messages, this is a deal breaker on its own. I've double checked all my settings	bug report
The New design is awful, having everything on the screen was a feauture of discord. Now it's almost the same to any other messenger. At least the pc version is still fine so i put 2 instead of 1 star	feature request
The app is not working?! For three days now its going on and off and now not working at all.	bug report
Discort bot doesn't work well in Afghanistan. I tried the same commands as other countries' users but got different results. I think Discord doesn't use its full potential in countries like us.	bug report
For whatever reason they got people that can't make a good UI and now you are forced to use it, I don't get what was wrong with the old one, it was optimised and user friendly, but now it's a mess. Sort it out and get people who have users experience in mind, not trying to make everything look complicated and fancy. Desktop users have the same layout so that's fine, mobile is not good nor optimised, was fine before this uncessary change	feature request
It's weird you have to answer or you're gonna be kicked out because some people don't answer messages	bug report

Minor UI inconsistencies must be fixed immediately. EDIT: Thanks for this update. Message editing is live now! I love this feature. I would love to see the increased attachment size limits.	feature request
Absolutely love the app. I trust Signal to keep my data secure. Im rating two stars because I use the app as my default message app. They're forcing me to have separate apps for messaging because they're removing SMS support. I've used this app for years. I dont want to have separate apps for messaging. Thats a huge inconvenience and not a good user experience at all.	feature request
In the past this app allowed sms messages to contact those that didn't use Signal (like members of my family, 2fa messages etc) while having more secure, encrypted messages between Signal users (like my friends). That allowed me to make it my primary messaging app instead of going back and forth between multiple. Now they plan to stop sms capablility. I will likely uninstall, because unsecure comms with everyone I care about is better than secure comms with only a small fraction of them.	feature request

It was perfect before Discord decided they had to break a good thing and now I can't even use another app without Discord glitching out and it takes an extra 5-10s on high speed wifi and 5G just to open the app. I hope there's a competitor soon because how the mighty Discord has fallen	bug report

Good for texting, but it has some issues. Thought it was fine up till maybe a week ago, when suddenly all the chats lost their names even though they are contacts, instead just displaying the number. More importantly, it no longer displays any pictures sent in the chats, either to or from me. I figured no problem, I'll just update. Which I do...and exactly 1 picture is now visible. The most recent one. Restarted the app multiple times, nothing changes. And thats super frustrating. All it says is "image or video is no longer available". Even the ones I've sent. Can't find any fix online, support page was no help. I want to rate higher cause i generally like the app, but this issue is a major handicap for me, to the point the app itself is almost worthless to me now. If there's a fix for this, please let me know and I'll gladly update ranking.	bug report

Ive used Discord for years and its always been great, but the new update has made it near impossible for me to use. Different chats dont load up when I switch channels and I dont always see if my messages have been sent. The UI is also making it slower and overall worse. Please make the new UI resemble the old one and I will change my review	bug report
Slow as hell but it works!!!	bug report
I loved this app until they dropped SMS support. It's the same thing that happened to Hangouts - a do everything app that just worked and then the developers went off the rails. I'm not using multiple apps to communicate, and I didn't really require secure comms except a few times. If they bring SMS/MMS back, I'll come back.	feature request

Since last update app is incredibly slow to load DMs, switching between server and DM is also very slow. Dont like the new layout either, discord had such a unique layout and by seperating server and DM it feels too much like any other messaging app. Its also less clear now whether a DM is unread or not. Really wish I hadnt put this app on auto update, wouldve rather stayed with the previous version/layout of discord	feature request

Countless bugs. Sometimes multiple messages are inside each other. Tapping the voice message button shows the "hold to record" message in the top left corner for some reason. Microphone button's visual bugs in VCs, being white (that shows its enabled) with the line over it (that shows its disabled) at the same time and vice versa. Today it decided to not load/send any images, videos and emojis. Reopening the app doesn't fix this. Thank you for all the lag spikes and bugs with the new update.	bug report

This app is terrible in every way. Today I was randomly logged out and as I have lost access to the email I used I can no longer log in. I will never use this app again.	bug report
I like the simplicity of the interface.	irrelevant information
works for texting. doesnt work much for pictures or phone calls at all. even on multiplatform/device callas and picture messages never go through.	bug report
Why, since this app is suppose be free, is it not allowing me to make calls? Update: I figured it out. But I'm uninstalling it. It appears the desktop version doesn't sinc with the phone app. And I'm not happy that you have to give it access to your contacts. That's super private info entrusted to me by family and friends. Why am I not allowed to pick and choose? I only use Skype to video chat with one person. Very intrusive. I'll stick with the desktop version.	bug report

Why is discord getting rid of the number tags at the end of names? It was a great system, I hate using apps that demand each user have a unique name because after a point it's simply not possible, I'm keeping my previous number tag in my name to keep it distinct. Please get rid of this, it was one of the things that made discord unique and easy to use.	feature request

Terrible after the new update. I can't navigate without the app bugging out. When I switch between the discord navigation UI, the bar goes down and is overlayed by my phone's navigation UI which means that I then can't switch between messages and servers because they can't Register when being under my phones navigation UI.	bug report

Great app, but the new UI layout update is abysmal -- the old layout was similar to the computer client which made it easy to use, now it's more difficult to navigate a server and to see the list of members. Your average Discord mobile user likely has it on their computer as well, so no reason to change up the UI to compete with other mobile apps (or at least I'm guessing that's why they did this?) I have no idea why they felt like they needed to do this.	feature request

Open source supremacy! Use Signal and don't let big tech leech off your data.	irrelevant information
I lost my phone and because of that can't access my Google Authenticator details. Discord doesn't permit me to log in again. So it means I will loose the account that I have had for a long time with much activities. There should be a way to recover one's account if this type of problem comes.	feature request
New icons and backend are fine, but changing the whole layout to whatever we have now was a big mistake, especially forcing it on the users.	feature request

New Ui sucks. It looks awful and bugs out so often. It's horrible accessibility wise. Overall, the mobile app sucks now.	bug report

Great app screws up sometimes but not to often	bug report
Safe and secure for those that only use signal. Not happy with the changes made.	feature request
I've enjoyed and used this app for years, but was just notified that they are dropping SMS support. That makes this just one more in a basket of messaging apps. They are overestimating the adoption of encrypted messaging for its own sake. It was great when it could be used as the SMS default because I knew that if my message could be secured, it would be. Now I need to manage my own app as well as everyone I message. No thank you.	feature request
I'm still not getting any notifications and it's frustrating when I'm in a group and can't get notified when people communicate in the group with me.	bug report
Can't hear sometimes on their phone and sometimes mine but for free can't complain need more free minutes for watch ads but won't give me sometimes idk y .	bug report
I gave a four-star review because it's sometimes glitches. It also doesn't load very fast when you're on a call. The last thing is is that it takes a long time to send messages.	bug report

Terms of use suspension...

Notifications are inconsistent and yikes	bug report
But I can't see the dial screen when I'm calling someone the screens black and I can't end a phone call. Oh and also pinger should be available without needing wifi connections. It'll make it a lot easier, especially if I don't always have wifi access which I could end up being stranded somewhere and I wouldn't be able to make a call because I wouldn't have wifi ..that's a true experience btw ... just pitching an idea you guys should keep in mind	bug report
Best way to communicate I ever had	irrelevant information
THE BEST messaging app avaliable. 4 stars because of the mobile update though	irrelevant information
I needed to get this app so that I would have a discrete number to give out to whoever I chose. While this was great to use for that, it was also frustrating. When I would get phone calls, I wouldn't hear the ring and ended up missing calls. Unless you keep your data turned on, you will miss messages and calls often. The Wi-Fi signal  given off by the app  fluctuates a lot. I have Wi-Fi through my cable, but I found myself just giving out my other cell number from Verizon, just to stop the insanity LOL.	bug report
This app isn't allowing me to sign up or in using my Gmail account alone. It's asking me to use both Gmail and Facebook accounts. I no longer have the Facebook account associated with my Gmail. So this app is worthless I'd give no stars if that was an option	bug report

I like the mobile plan but I don't...the app seems more cramped in my opinion,I don't like how I gotta switch through messages and servers when I could've easily done that before with no issues,I like the mobile idea,I just wish there was like a way to swap back to the original app if people don't like the update.(I do kinda like the idea..but I don't at the same time.)	feature request
Never got service, and no support.	bug report
Don't bother downloading SCAM  I completed a task for 48 mins but only received 3 mins. Then I made a 17 sec call and had a 0 balance	bug report
They are removing SMS/ Text message support. That kinda kills it for me, since I'm now stuck using Google again. The fact that they tie accounts to phone numbers is a serious deanonymizing vector. Not actually secure when they have a personal identifier that specific. Too tightly coupled with your contact list.	feature request
quality of calls. Too many audio issues	bug report

I loved discord but recent update made it so a person cannot stay in private call by themselves to save bandwidth but please please make it an option to turn on / off auto disconnect as i liked staying in the call while waiting for people to get free so they could just join me without ringing.	feature request
Its ok not perfect because somtimes it does not work somtimed	bug report
Worked for a few days.. Now I can't make calls, can't send messages. Looking for support is not user friendly at all. Loosing my number.	bug report
Happens more than once! If I receive some message in phone Skype during lunch or away from office. The same message disappear in my laptop Skype	bug report
This app is pretty good. I don't have any pop up ads the only flaw would be a delayed call, it will tell you that you missed one but you don't get a notification when someone does call.	feature request

New UI is terrible, buggy and hard to use overall.	bug report
I can't upload image and video to my friend and she either can't send me.	bug report
Tedious. Very user unfriendly. They can learn a few tricks from Messenger on how to attach more than one images or gifs in a single message. Horribly designed emojis. On the text box, give the option to the user to set emoji button instead of the sticker button. And yes, badly designed stickers too. All in all, signal is just not there to replace WhatsApp or Messenger. Sorry.	feature request
Please, if you could change the mobile user interface BACK TO NORMAL RN OR IM GONNA SOB!	feature request
Perpetually glitchy. There are long standing bugs that have been around for years. At this point we just use it because it still generally works, and switching over to another group chat app sounds annoying. Most glitches I encounter have to do with likes. If someone likes your message while you're looking at it, there's about a 50/50 chance of whether the display updates for you. If you tap on a message to see who liked it, sometimes you just aren't allowed to tap a second time to hide it. Etc	bug report
No longer a texting app. Dropping support for the most widely used type of text message may make it "more secure" but I'm not going to use multiple apps to text both my security-minded friends and the vast majority of other people in my contacts. I'm sure it'll be great for everyone's covert ops still, so have fun storming the castle.	feature request

Absolutely terrible for user interface. Extremely difficult to operate, and does not work fully. Sometimes video works, sometimes not. Trying to use this to chat with my grandma and I can't figure it out. 1 star. Terrible operating system.	bug report
Was my go to app for texting, but with the removal of SMS, I'm removing signal. It's not worth the trouble of having two apps for one thing, I'll just move everything elsewhere.	irrelevant information
Am very very displeased with the new update where you can't type on screen while in video chat!!

Dec 2023 edit - while I enjoy the pure black theme, the newest update to discord basically is the opposite of my previous review below. The app no longer works great, and sometimes it doesn't work at all! The changes are unintuitive, and I often find myself accidentally replying to people or struggling to get to where I need to go. I hope fixes come quickly. (2022 5-stars)The app works great! Intuitive and reliable for my uses.	bug report
This would be great if it worked properly, many times it seems like it asleep. Then a bunch of messages come through, also sound stops working if phone is on to many hours. I have to reboot the phone for sound to work again .	bug report

It constantly reconnect network	bug report
Fake free call app only heard their first 2 seconds every call then silence as if you muted eachother	bug report
The amount of one star ratings in the past 24 hours should tell you that you need to revert this UI update. Why haven't you done so yet? Links don't open in apps anymore, only browser, swiping left to look at member listings or look at pins doesn't work, and the amount of times I have to look at messages to clear them is ridiculous when I open the message from the notification itself. Listen to your user base. You're making bad business choices by not doing that.	feature request
Yeah, I like using textfree but it just keeps loading even when wi-fi is full connection. Also, when I send picture the other person can't see it. Fix please.	bug report

This app hasn't given me trouble until the most recent update. I seem to be missing a fair amount of icons, such as the upload media button, the notification that tells me if my friends are online, or even the icon to pull up side menus (They still function). It kind of keeps getting worse, everytime I log on something else is missing.	bug report
Much slower after latest update	bug report
Just constant bugs. Can't see posts, interface freezes. I don't usually write reviews but this has been ongoing for months now	bug report
Great App for communicating!	irrelevant information
Newest update is horrible, laggy chat, forcing all bots to use the same prefix. This update makes discord feel like an alpha version of the previous update. Please revert or fix the bugs, watching chat gives me a headache. Terrible changes. (Update:Still very slow and laggy compared to how it used to be.) (Update:Still horrible, very sad this is how it is gonna stay) How in the world an app can go from basically perfect to completely unusable is amazing.	bug report

Good app, losing SMS features. I used signal as my main SMS app for several years now and now that it will no longer support this function I am reconsidering the utility of this app. It's good, but without this option I have difficulty recommending it as an easy swap for my friends and family as to a non-privacy focussed person it's just another messenger app that they need to install. Was 5/5 now 3/5.	feature request

Hi Discord , my Discord profile looks so different. I mean It looks like an old version. I thought I should update it, but no, and I don't know what the problem is.	bug report

I haven't seen a single person who likes the new layout update and the fact that the discord twitter page is basically telling people to just get used to it is insane. I don't see the motivation for making a layout that the majority of your users hate. Isn't the goal to have people *want* to use the app? If it's not broken, why bother trying to fix it? To be honest, I wouldn't even care half as much if it weren't for the complete disregard of user feedback.	feature request

It's good. True E2EE, even in group chats. Dark mode. Video and voice calls. They're still working on making it as feature rich as Telegram, but doing that while keeping it completely secure is hard, and extremely expensive. Give it time. EDIT: It's been years and I still can't send an image file without compression. -1 star. EDIT2: SMS support is disappearing. Massive step backwards. THE way I discover people use Signal is that I go to send an SMS, and it tells me thay have Signal. Not anymore.	feature request

It's a mystery how this app got such a high rating. It worked well upon the first installation. I mean, it's a messenger, I can send and receive messages. Yeah, applause. When I had to switch to a different device though it made me jump a series of hoops, with the final blocker being a request for a PIN that I allegedly set up at the first installation, which I never did, effectively preventing me from ever using the app again. So it's a one-time-only app, rewarded with just as many stars.	bug report
SMS has been removed, which was the only way I was able to convince friends and family to use it. Now it is gone they have uninstalled and I might as well too. No point in just talking to myself.	feature request
I've used discord (mobile and desktop) for 4 years now. Lately I've used mobile since 2021 on my android phone. It is awful. I've experienced so many issues the list would takes pages of space to write. But worst of all, the new UI is *extremely* unintuitive and awful. So many of the changes are completely unnecessary, make the app confusing and irritating to navigate, and cause more issues, like discord refusing to show messages or servers randomly. Until it changes back, discord isnt worth it	bug report

I've been having some serious issues with this app. Sometimes my calls won't connect even though I have a WIFI signal and other times when I do get a connection it keeps breaking up. Is there something that can be done?	bug report
A more accurate name would be "Text Free (by watching an ad for a minute of talk time or single text message)." Not even the slightest exaggeration either. Phone numbers are lost after 30 days of inactivity. Don't get this app unless you want to buy credits or get a premium subscription. Absolutely can't recommend this app when so many free alternatives exist that don't bombard you with advertising everytime you do anything. Even the creators of this app must wonder why anyone would choose it.	bug report

Sorry, Signal: dropping SMS support is not going to make the world use secure messaging - instead they'll switch away from Signal and back to SMS. I can't remember who does and doesn't have Signal, so by removing SMS support I'll end up only using SMS (or a rival that lets me use both from within the same app). I didn't have a problem distinguishing secure and non-secure messages; I had a problem getting all my contacts onto Signal - that'll be even harder now. Disappointing doesn't cover it.	feature request

With the removal of SMS support, you can't use Signal as your only messaging app anymore. Now you have to get another app and, frankly, there's no reason to keep this one. YOU try convincing your friends to switch to Signal AND convince all THEIR friends to do it too! Idiotic move.	feature request

This *was* a 5 star app. But they're dropping SMS support, which is a huge mistake. They pretend the reasons for doing so are user-centric, but in doing so, they alienate their users by treating them like idiots. It's all cover for what, at the end of the day, is a question of developer resources and effort. SMS support was one of Signal's key differentiators and a vital onramp. If I just want secure messaging without SMS, I'll just use Wickr. Say goodbye to your hard-earned users, Signal.	feature request

New update is horrendous. It's gross and cartoony, and nothing I use regularly is in the same place. This makes the app not just inaccessible but hostile for neurodivergent users, of which there are MANY. I don't want to swipe to reply, I want to see who's online. My DMs already moved and lost a lot of navigability but now it's somehow even worse. Reacts are now huge buttons, and the threads button is intrusive for something we don't use much.	feature request
Im very dissapointed in the new update. While trying to make it flow better, the app has turned into an inconvenience.

Amazing app if they weren't removing sms support. Obviously sms is less secure but if I want to message my grandmother I'm not going to have her install and be confused by this app. Honestly removing sms will make things less secure since it will be easier to just use another non secure sms app instead of Signal. Out of my 100 or so contacts only 3 have signal... it's not worth it and I will convince them to get off Signal as well.	feature request

The new color schemes after the update are super high contrast and hard to look at. What use is a messaging app that I can't look at due to eye strain? What's more, the "new messages" function bugs out almost every time and doesn't jump to my last place in the conversation. Which is obviously no good when keeping up with the conversation is the whole purpose of this app...	bug report

Great app for talking with friends and creating communities, but update after update, the actual structure ans functionality of the app gets worse and worse! I've been using the app for almost six years now, and this last update that rearranged the entire structure and layout of the mobile version is horrible! Not to mention wholey unnecessary! A majority of the recent updates have been awful and entirely pointless! With only a few things being fixed, and more stuff for nitro subs! Not great!	feature request

This app is a good app don't get me wrong, but recently with this stupid update all the originality and shortcuts to getting to certain screens just disappeared plus the app has become so slow and buggy that it bugs out my entire phone.

And I'm unstalling this app until y'all fix it or get an update and one thing I want in the update I LESS ADS NOBODY LIKES ADS WHEN THERE TRYING TO TEXT. And I'm not trying to pay 10 dollars not that I'm cheap or broke!!!!!	bug report
Discord on Android is pretty useful in itself. But what isn't useful is the app CONSTANTLY suffers from connection problems. No matter how fast your internet is. Almost every time I open the app while it was previously running, nothing loads at all for a good 10 seconds to a full minute. 10 seconds may not seem much, but the PC app can boot up, and load everything in 5 seconds or less. Considering how fast devices are these days, this is unacceptable. Please fix your connection problems.	bug report

Notifications still don't work, you click it, it takes you into the app and straight to a chunk of random text. With every update the app progressively gets worse and worse and worse. If you leave the app to go to another then switch back the discord app doesn't even refresh until a minute unless you restart the app. Overall a horrible experience.	bug report

I'm not sure who had the idea to change how replies are sent from mobile, but it's a bad change. I just want to easily check who is on. Before the update the app was a 10/10.

I use to like this app until it started updating all the time messing things up. I have an LG G2 and I no longer receive notifications when I get a text and half the time I never get the text message or I only get half the text. Very disappointed in this app recently!	bug report
I have been using this app on Android for nearly 5 years now, I've been through so many updates and I'm not really picky but the past few ones have been the most annoying. One of my issues is that when I turn off displaying images to save data and click on the images I only want to see, the images don't open in discord like they used to but load in a different browser. Also the app has become much heavier and less smooth to navigate. Edit: your article didn't help either	bug report
Not private, they read your messages .... If your system is able to flag that an incoming text contains a verification code, that means you read your user's messages, period.	irrelevant information

It's pretty good for like group chats and stuff. Sometimes people with older dated phones have trouble using the app but overall it's pretty good.

It's okay when it is working.	irrelevant information
I like the app, but there is no distinction between the Creator and anyone else in the group. You might say something not even remotely offensive, and if some random member is offended, they will kick you. Could you potentially make it so only the Creator has kicking/banning rights, and is allowed to assign admins to the chat? Because getting banned by someone who just joined when I've been in for 5 months longer is annoying to say the least.	feature request

I like the new interface, seems more efficient, speedy and compact. The only problem I have is about hiding and unhiding messages.

When my friend  direct messaged me earlier today, the notification showed up but I was puzzled for awhile because I had no new messages in my inbox, until he told me he sent a message.  It would not show up in my inbox.	feature request
Terrible app. Freezes constantly despite having excellent wifi connection. Can't even import contacts. Useless.	bug report
Forces you to pay! If you want to receive verification codes, you're obligated to sign up for a subscription. It actually notifies you when a verification code has been received and that it's blocked it! Completely useless!	feature request

I started using Signal because it also had SMS, even though few of my contacts actually had Signal. Now SMS support is being removed.

The app contain many bugs now after the new updates.	bug report
I only have this phone to communicate momentarily while my phone is off. The few issues I have is how many times it freezes up where you can't hang up or answer incoming calls and you can't receive or send calls over certain wifi. When you turn a setting off it will still be there. For example I turned off the huge animated gifs that pop up while texting and they never went away. NOW I don't get notified when I receive a text. I've updated refreshed etc. It's just wonky	bug report
Every time I call my money card to try and monitor my funds itll never let me through saying I'd entered the wrong information	bug report
App closes on its own. Calls wont go through	bug report
How dare you remove SMS!?! Do you even realize how many people in the world don't use this app? Half of my generation hasn't even heard of it and you have the audacity to take away my ability to contact them. I am beyond mad right now. The app was perfect until then. Shame on you all. I've used this app for years. I really can't understand you all right now. But, I hope you're happy with losing half of your users, because it's going to happen if they can't text outside of this messaging app.	feature request
I released my number trying to get a new one and now its saying something went wrong! Unreliable! I would have kept the damn number!	bug report
A solid chat app, but periodically a few bugs pop up. Mainly, every once in a while the app fails to load messages, sometimes for days. I engage in all the standard troubleshooting methods, but most of the time I just need to wait. Overall though it's great for my purposes.	bug report
I hate it alot of scammers on it	irrelevant information
Functions correctly as what it does. Knocking off the stars because the app does not implement system dark mode properly so even though the OS is dark and the Skype app is dark, the nav bar is bright white.	feature request
Notifications are very delayed .. some people say they don't get the call ring on the other end and instead the other user gets a notification of a missed called 30mins to an hour later. I left the app sadly as it's not fast enough in allowing me to talk to my contacts. The other issue is the media being sent is not grouped together .. there is no web app support instead you need to install an app on desktop which also fails to sync messages correctly. The video call quality is extremely bad.	bug report
Tried using this many times and it seems to crash / cookie issues / please fix thank you and have a blessed day !	bug report
I can finally talk to my friend from home	irrelevant information
The app barely works. It makes my keyboard lag when I'm in the app, and when I exit out of the app and close it, my phone freezes up for a few seconds and the app crashes, almost every time. If you exit out of the app for any reason with a message waiting but not sent, it will delete it 95% of the time, so if you needed to go fact check something, too bad, your whole paragraph is gone. Also, the ad that pops up underneath the keyboard directly after sending a message makes it impossible to quickly send a fix for a typo (caused by the lag) because I now have to close the app store and go back to the conversation. It definitely needs a lot of work, especially since it only sometimes sends and recieves texts reliably.  Changed my rating from 3 stars to 2 after I spent all day thinking everyone was ignoring me just to get flooded with texts and see all mine send all at once in a random order this evening. It really seems like the quality of this app is sinking, it used to be much better. I decided to switch to TextNow and it's already so much easier to use. I'll be deleting this app and definitely not coming back.	bug report
Too many ads it pisses me off	irrelevant information
New app does not function. Closes randomly. Can't open pictures. Exquisitely ugly	bug report
It's great...until you have to transfer to a newer device and then it doesn't want to give you back your chat history. You can back up the history all you want but actually being able to access it is an entirely different story. The "help FAQs" don't help either, outside giving the illusion of being helpful.	bug report
Ever since the last update, it is super annoyingly slow.  Makes me just close it rather than wanting to use it.  Fix your interface	bug report

Supports all the required features including high quality video an audio calls.

Its AWESOME TO STAY IN TOUCH	irrelevant information
Update: I continue to use the app with some people. We also use it for phone calls sometimes. It is an excellent communication replacement when you have good Wi-Fi, but no cell coverage. We used it extensively when our son was in England where his phone had no SMS. ______ Discontinuing sms is suicide. Do they really think that I can convince 100 contacts to switch to signal? I can't even get all my family on it. Juggling two apps is stupid for anyone who has more than one signal contact.	feature request
My debit card was charged 4.99 and I did not authorize it	bug report
Was useable, but I barely use it with the new update, it's a total mess. Almost no benefits to the change and the app feels 10 times more sluggish than it did before. If there was an option to chose between 'new' and 'classic' discord when you first loaded the app for instance, maybe it would work but as it stands the decision to change the app to this bloatware monstrosity is one of the more baffling ones in recent memory.	feature request
A pain to setup, no import capabilities, unless every contact is on your phone. Moronic	bug report

So it's good for the most part, but my problem is the new voice mesaage option, I can send a 5 second voice message, but when I try to send longer voice messages they don't want to send. Fix this please.	feature request
It's a great VOIP app that enables any one to speak with each other free of cost with only the need of an Internet connection. The reception is often good. My only criticism is that when you have the app open and you migrate over to another app and come back to the Skype app, it reboots so you end up losing the chat box you were in.	feature request

It's a great app overall, BUT ADD BACK THE NUMBERS. IT MAKES IT EASIER TO CATCH PEOPLE WHO ARE PRETENDING TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.	feature request
I'm not one to review bomb, never done it before. But this new update has made me use the app so much less to the point that on the off chance I do open it up I close it straight away because the UI is so terrible now. If they hadn't removed the ability to revert the changes and use the old layout I couldn't care less, I don't understand why it isn't an option so there's a best of both worlds.	feature request

So far, so necessary, it is a great way to communicate with friends and family.	irrelevant information
Similar to other people's reviews, the app frequently gets stuck on the current channel's chat and every other channel and server shows the same chat until I restart the app. Was never an issue before until the last updates.

Garbage new UI makes the app exceedingly clunkier to use and way less intuitive, for absolutely no reason other than chasing after an UI trend started by other messaging apps that fundamentally cannot apply to Discord due to how different it is to them in actual intended function.	feature request

It's pretty bad app. When using it for a work: each message or group call understand all the pain of using this.

But now I'm happy not using this anymore.	bug report
App itself works for that it would get a great score, however they have some Sneaky Ads which are just Nonsense. I get it the app is free therefore you put up with ads. The reason I say the Ads are sneaky is the following. There are times when an Ad will Pop up and you go to Close it by hitting the X in the corner & what happens? It takes you to the freaking ad page. The "X" was fake. Look back at the Ad & you notice that there is another button in corner that says Close.	feature request

The best App for privacy reasons Because WhatsApp does not give such type of privacy policy And the owner of facebook and WhatsApp they want only our data to doing there business So, be aware and delete the WhatsApp because now a days so many scams are done by WhatsApp So use this app and get secure üîê our data	irrelevant information

I have loved using this app for a long time, used it since 2017, and previously had a five star review on it, but it gets more frustrating to use with every update. They keep adding new UI changes that are entirely unnecessary and just make the experience worse for no clear reason. I buy nitro because I think the emoji and animated banner perks are worth it, but if the app gets more user unfriendly I don't want to pay for that.	feature request

I pay monthly for an limited ads experience, I literally get all of the ads that were previously shown. This only happened after a recent update. The little ads are fine and it shows up properly on my other phone. My new phone doesn't. FIX IT ASAP, I LITERALLY PAY MONTHLY.	bug report
App is great, but the newest update did something that ruined the AMOLED mode... Now it's just regular dark mode with AMOLED side menus...	feature request
Yeah i have a bunch of issues with the app, first it takes long for a call to go through, then sometimes it bugs out with speaker. My friend says i sound far away sometimes and sometimes i make a call and my friend picks up but the calling continues. also when i am writing a message and someone calls me a big chunk of my message dissapears when i answer the call.

This used to be a really good application, great way to keep in touch with friends and have it sync to your games. As of late the app seems to be going downhill, the latest update completely revamped the look of the application. Its now much more clunky and non intuitive, you can't open discord via the notif bar without the channel view breaking the app entirely. Every update released lately seems to be mostly for those paying the annual 100 dollar fee	bug report
App works mostly well, but there is a bug with "upgrading" from Boost plans to Nitro plans, where you will be charged for it hut the payment fails. I got refunded, but the solution (after a week of back and forth with tech support) is "wait a month, and then try to resubscribe with the plan you want". Frustrating to deal with.	bug report

Why Skype is getting slower day by day. My Manager sent me a message & its showing notification prompt after 3 days. Overall its getting slow üêå	bug report
What I find absolutely ridiculous is that after using this app for years, you changed the function of this app to where I can't receive verification codes unless I pay something like $6 a week? The reason I downloaded this is because it was paid for by the ads that I saw. Now all the accounts that I have from instagram, facebook among all the others, I can't get into these accounts unless I get a verification code using my phone app. I have to pay for this now? It's the bait n switch.	feature request

my main issue is this latest update. why are my private messages at the bottom? i hate it. and it gets harder and harder to log out of one account and log in to the next one. i wish there was an easy option for switching accounts like there is on desktop. i feel like there used to be and it got removed.	feature request

The latest update of the app that splits it in separate menus is incredibly bad UI/UX. On top of that the app is becoming slower with each update. I am considering entirely uninstalling from my phone, because I dread looking up notifications knowing that my flagship phone will not be sufficient to use the app properly. This used to be a messenger app with some neat functions and is gradually turning into a marketplace.	feature request
Can be more better. Sometimes my phone stops working when I open skype. Video can be more better too!	bug report
Idk why but discord is crashing for me??? It would let me either go to another channel in a server or go to my dms. I'm stuck in this one channel and can't leave!!

Discords most recent update has actually made accessibility worse with eye straining themes and the performance issues are incredibly frustrating.

On windows certainly better than on Android. Sure, functionality is the same. And yet, on Android I miss every message or call unless I have the app open just when the call/message comes in.

It's still the best audio and text chat app but the newest UI update was clearly done to justify someone's job. Why did the ability to search other channels go away?

As of version 4.16.9 or so, Signal removed your ability to get your SMSs, MSMs, and associated media files out of Signal. You can create encrypted backups, but they provide no tool to help you get anything useful out of the backup. The former CEO/developer stated on Github that if you want such a thing you should write it yourself. So, basically they've created a walled garden. Beware.	bug report

Beware that Signal is developed by people that love to decide exacty how you should do things, with zero pragmatic thinking. Don't get used to it! The app won't work unless you update it every three months and they may remove any functionality at random. Backups are regularly broken. It used to be able to work as the default messaging app on Android, by sending Signal messages to other Signal users and traditional text messages to non-Signal users but this feature was removed.	feature request
Going to throw a fit. Every single time I open a chat, it's a dozen messages up and I have to scroll down. If I switch to something else and back to that same chat, it's scrolled back UP AGAIN AND I HAVE TO SCROLL DOWN, AGAIN.	bug report

Terrible update. Ever since the whole layout change was brought in, the app is littered with bugs everywhere. I can't receive messages until I actually open the app, phone calls don't ring either until I'm actually in the app? I mean, the whole point of having notifications is when your out of the app and something pops in, you should get notified. I had to download Skype classic for my laptop to rectify this, unfortunately the phone doesn't seem to have a similar alternative. I'd give it less than 1 star if I could.	bug report
I still believe that Signal is a must-have, but I am really disappointed at the decision to stop supporting unsecured SMS. The developers seem to be more interested in feeling smart than making smart decisions for the app.	feature request
Just stopped working. Even sent emails. To resolve the issue. Nit a single reply from signal. Disappointing	bug report
I love Discord! It's such a good way to interact and communicate with all of my favorite YouTube creators as well as connecting with gamers.

I've used discord before and have never faced this problem. yesterday I created a new discord account and I started verifying it. it asked for my email and that went pretty smoothly and then it asked me to verify my phone number and that's when it got complicated.

I have used Discord for years and loved it! I have used it more than any other messenging app. But this new UI update is the worst thing they have done. I get that they're trying new things, but why get rid of the ability to toggle back to the old layout that I love? I know it was there just a couple of months ago, and now it's gone! I HATE this new UI and now I am trapped in it. WHY??!	feature request
This app is great the only problem I have is when I start texting and a new ad pops up it stops my typing or it will erase my message	bug report
When I used groupme on my iPhone, I never had problems. Heard of others having probs but I never did. I switched to android for the first time and... lemme tell you, it's a different experience. It's quite a joke actually. I miss half the messages (says I already read them), it randomly decides that I didn't read any messages since a few months ago so if I want to open up a group to see today's messages, I have to scroll down for a couple minutes üò≥.

New layout sucks, bring back the old one. Switching servers feels clunky. Searching has been made difficult to do. The app feels more awkward to navigate. Sharing between servers now needs you to go back to edit the post. Cleaner does not always equal better when you add steps for people to do things.	feature request
Fills the inbox with spam daily. It would be way better if it worked with Bluetooth for calls as a tablet only has a speaker. Also I wish it could go on my lock screen like my Gmail app does. The signature options a joke. It pastes it in the text box before you type so you end up having to delete your sig before you can type a message. All and all its a really poorly coded app. I don't think they care about how it runs or works as long as people download it so they can steal your private information and spam you to death. It's sad really because it could be a good app but the maker just wants money more then he wants to code a good solid product	bug report
I echo everyone else, in that the app used to show notifications, and now it no longer does for me. I have to randomly check the app to see if I have any messages, which is a pain, and I n often miss time sensitive messages because of this flaw.	bug report

Guessing the Discord Dev Team motto is "If it ain't broke, break it" because they took a perfectly functional app and introduced a bunch of bugs that weren't there at all for years. Now the chat randomly jumps around from new messages, trying to change a server profile can either show the wrong server or it'll keep taking you off the page while you try to edit it, and images randomly don't save anymore. It's frustrating. Please fix this mess. Update: It got worse. Replies are broken.	bug report

update as of jan 2024: app still is garbage. Every single update actively makes the app worse and harder to use.

I rarely leave reviews but this latest overhaul of discord is a complete downgrade. Where to begin? Extra steps to get between private messages and public servers. Swiping to the left doesn't bring up the person list (it forces you to reply if you swiped over a message). On PC its setting statuses for me without asking me first! And then there are a slew of basic functions that are broken, or not working properly! Revert changes, or let us choose changes in the settings and options menu! PLEASE	bug report

signal not clear	bug report
I did like Signal, but to only learn today from a random in app notif that SMS is going away is horrible. Signal should be more up front with this info. Now I'm scrambling to save data because this info is 3+ months old and there's no official removal date. That's terrible customer communication, I won't tolerate an app that doesnt respect me enough to keep me in the loop appropriately. Good luck Signal, liked the idea but I won't be forced to convert users for you. Do that with your actions.	feature request
Why we cannot use video calls for a month now? What happened? Pls fixed it	bug report
ive been using discord for years and my experience has been mostly positive! however, with the most recent update i cant save changes to my profile picture or banner? i do not see a save button at all and im wondering if this is something others are experiencing or not. i do hope this gets fixed because i tend to change my profile picture often. i even re-installed the app and it will not let me save it no matter what.	feature request
This app is awsome and all except for one major thing about it when your not on your phone for a couple of days or dont use the app for a couple days it makes you have to use a different number and all the people on contacts dont know who you are when you text or call them. This app would be a lot better if it didnt make you have to get a new number all the time.	feature request

New version does not carry over your access permissions for the Camera and Gallery, nor it pops them up for you to set when you try posting. So if you get "failed to send message" whenever you try and post the image go to your phone's app settings and add permissions manually to access them.	bug report
Great app but one problem sometimes there is way too many ads	bug report
I had previously rated Signal 5 stars. It was the perfect app to replace Samsung's SMS Messages app. I could encrypted message with those that had it and text those that didn't. It was great. Now they are removing SMS support, because "people who really care about security don't use SMS." I've had to re-install Messages. What a bummer.	feature request
No notification popped up! Even after uninstall and reinstall the apps. How to resolve?	bug report
I have used this app for years and it is just starting to give me problems with these updates and ads. I understand that bills need to be paid, and to keep it free for all to enjoy. But the ads don't have to be so in your face, taking up the whole screen at times, I'm trying to type to someone. I know Walmart exists,I know stores/websites exists, the tiny banner was good enough, I don't need the commericials too.The ads are the biggest culprit to the freezing of this app on my particular phone.	bug report

It's functional at times, but absolutely frustrating otherwise. I can no longer send gifs from my gallery as of date. This, and at one point, I was completely unable to see gifs or reactions (there would just be words like 'sad' or 'heart' beneath photos, and if I wanted to send a reaction of my own, I would have to guess where the Emojis were, as not even the words were visible). It's not a perfect app, clearly, but seeing as I can call and text, it serves its main function.	bug report

Guys, what happened, discord was fantastic, it's the only way I talk to my friends. The new update isn't just bad stylistically, it also just doesn't work.

This is text message on steroids. It has a lot of features you can't get on other message apps. Some of the features are being able edit a message you already sent.

The only weak point is that not many people use this app.	feature request

I found the text free app to work well. I like the freedom to choose whatever number I want from a list of available numbers.

Seems these numbers are being used by spammers. When I tried to use the number to open an account the number was instantly blocked for previous spam activity. I had gotten a membership from text free that I had to cancel because the number is unusable to me. It cancels at the end of the billing period so they got a months worth of payment out of me. What a waste of money and an undeserved high rating.	bug report

At least it's "free" that's why it's gets one star. To say the least it's very buggy and scratchy on both ends when you call someone. Service drops with great wifi. There's no message notifications and when people call there's no ringing. So I've literally missed important calls.You literally have to go into the app to see if anyone did. And that's after unnecessary amount of ads pop up. They want to pay for the "good stuff". But if that's all you get. I would imploy you to use a different app.	bug report

I just got the update! It's terrible! Biggest gripes: 1) Swipe to reply replaces functionality to swipe left to see members of the server. I've never used swipe to reply in any app and I never will. 2) Servers and DMs separated from each other on completely different screens for seemingly no reason at all. Number of taps & swipes to get to a DM is unchanged. Just inconvenient for those who got used to the old app or the PC layout. I'll probably install an old version while I can.	feature request

It didn't work but it was a great idea. Kept at 3 stars as a new bug appears when setting up transfer of signal accounts.

Good i love the app It's so fast and Cool	irrelevant information
I don't get notification for half my messages and non of the notification are loud enough. I think you should also add quick reply option!	bug report
This app gets you internet calling and texting through wifi without cell service but it's nearly unusable and test a nerve with the ads that pop up. I usually don't know if I got to hang up my call and a 30 sec ad will pop up preventing me from hanging up. Or during text I send one then ad pops up for a minute. If other options are available maybe try them first. Textnow needs to be more affordable with less ads even if someone is on the free version. They use to be a little better, not now.	feature request

Signal, get it together. Dropping sms support is the dumbest decision you can make. People will absolutely stop using this because of your very poorly thought out decision. IPhone users aren't going to ditch Imessage. I was happy that a few of my friends had signal. I could talk securely with them. But they aren't going to keep two texting apps. Neither will I. Change your sms decision or f off.	feature request

It's gotten a lot better in recent months. It still does a poor job of reflecting the presence of the other person. It will often say that the other person was last seen hours or days ago even when the person is typing something to you in the chat window.	bug report

Awesome. People I haven't talk to in many years. Thanks!	irrelevant information
I've really enjoyed using this app for awhile but it seems to have some issues as of late. My messages take forever to go through or receive, if at all. Incoming calls don't pop up for me until the 5th or 6th ring on the other end...if at all. Video calls never work. I get taken to the page that should work then and inescapable pop up tries to make me login with credentials I don't have. I don't get it. What happened to this previously stable and dependable app?	bug report
Its a nice App Altough when i tried to enter my phone Number it says another discord account is using it which is so annoying I don't have any other accounts	bug report
Is unsafe, to me anyway. I was hacked when I aquired this app.	bug report

Things break every other week or so and this has been the case for months. For instance a few weeks ago I had a problem where non text channels would disappear and reappear if I reinstall. Now with the latest update all my messages go to the same channel no matter where I am. Avatars disappear and reappear randomly. All functionality on the web version is still intact, so it's really just the app misbehaving. Kindly do some more testing before releasing new versions.	bug report
I can't verify my number	bug report
Its a great app when it works but god forbid it doesn't and you go through all the hoops trying to get and answer i wanted to find out if im texting someone that doesn't have textfree or my textfree # saved will it be an anonymous text and also why when i reinstall the app and open it i have unread texts that disappear before i can open it and i have no blocked #s and no way of retrieving them.At this point just hope the text wasnt important! Was 3* changed to 1* for lack of response sorry!!	bug report
Overall this app is good, however recently I and other people were having a problem with posting either a video or a meme and it just didn't allow us to post them, said that the files are too big. The video has 1.9 mb. How? Second problem is the image and video compression. It doesn't work, I think it just increases the file size than lowering it. It would be good if you could turn it off in the settings.	bug report

New u.i. is bad.optimizing on Samsung foldable is horrible.everything is paywalled. frankly, there is no reason to use this app	bug report
used to be a solid 4 stars for me, however this newest update is incredibly annoying and unneccesarily complicating. I did not need to have my private messages and servers on different screens, in fact this makes it less organised and clear than it used to be. I did not need to swipe to reply to messages, it was useful to see who was online on the same screen, this did not need removing. The hue of dark mode did not need changing, it feels weird on my eyes now. I could go on.	feature request
Not possible to make video calls on desktop. Only debian-based linux package on official site. Forced to use contacts to add names to chats.	bug report
Ugh, the new design or update made the app way too buggy to really use. The app lags badly when trying to switch convo or servers. Every once in a blue moon, when select the channel, I go into the previous channel I was in and not the channel I selected. The channel name change but the chat isn't. I'm just disappointed in this new update.	bug report
I personally think that it is one of the best social apps. Although it is good it needs some more improvements. Besides that it is a pretty good app. The nitro is not really needed though	feature request

Latest update literally breaks all swipe gestures for me on my Sony phone. Discord really seems to be going backwards lately. "Hard at work to make discord better" and yet my experience seems to deteriorate. I hope at least this can be fixed soon rather than taking a few years just like how it took you guys a few years to finally adapt light or dark mode to phone system settings. My review keeps coming closer to a 1 star with all this nonsense lately	bug report

Unable to login to app even after uninstalling and reinstalling it.. After i enter my phone number it doesnt send the opt and doesn't go to the next step.. I have tried a bunch of times..

I was looking for a replacement for whatsapp and for while this was good but for awhile now it hasn't been as good. At first I was excited to meld it with my regular messaging app but then after working fine for awhile, it started acting up. When I replied to group messages they were showing up in other people's phones as a thread of just me. So I unmelded them. Now I only get notifications IF I open the app. Not everyone getsy messages and my moms aren't coming In to me. Updating doesn't help.	bug report

Silently downscales sent images to much worse resolution/quality. It's a show stopper. I don't want a chat program to take decisions on how to alter my private communications, it's unacceptable. There is no technical excuse for it either, it's not year 1998, gigabit Internet is normal. Other than that, it's good program although sending a photo from Android camera remains somewhat cumbersome compared to e.g. Samsung or Google Messages.	bug report

Sad, the only problem I used to have was Discord refusing to stay on Bluetooth if I opened software that had access to the call interface.

Text is fine. However notifications rarely if ever,show up. I have to open the app to receive notifications. Calling is terrible. Delay, echo, static, muted, everything you could possibly have wrong with making and receiving calls. Not to men ton when called, phone only rings for incoming 25% of the time (and that's being generous) and the kicker, if you have this app obviously you can't afford to put $ into this, tapjoy offers minutes for spiffs, but doesn't reciprocate.

Love the app. The previous issues with blend are corrected. However, now the generated images do not load correctly as before. Often times the images do not load until hours later. Reopening, force closing the app, and phone restart does not fix this issue. UPDATE: 11/30/23 Generated images load faster, but not always consistently. Restarting app often works. UPDATE:: 12/7/23 Images now load as they should. Now would like to able to add 5 images to blend from the clipboard instead of folders.	bug report
I loved this app, but now it's ending support for sms. I tried to get all my friends to use signal but can't make them.

Worked fine until the latest update, now it's incredibly slow and laggy with tons of crashes. Additionally, notifications barely work and I'm usually never notified of receiving a message until hours and sometimes even days after it was sent.	bug report
New update is horrible. Can't use search option quickly anymore because it's extremely slow + whole app is glitchy, for example if I get notif for a message and click on it, it doesn't take me to that message. Had to download old version of the app from the internet and stop auto updates here, so app would be usable again.	bug report
They fixed the picture posting issue for Android and it seems to be working together all around.	bug report
I'm having a hard time with this app.I tried calling and I can not hear anything from me and from the other end.only this app do that why?	bug report

I love the app.  I was excited about the new emojis..  but ever since the update..  I cannot view them.. and also when I post a picture..  it stays as an attachment .. and keeps posting. Please make updates..  or solutions to my issues!!	feature request
Would give five stars, if some of the frequently reoccurring ads didn't occupy way over half of my screen. Seriously?  Wish I could find an ad-blocker for this application.	feature request
Amazing because its free text with includes minutes. But the constant ads are annoying and distracting. At least have them fade out after a while. So 3/5.	feature request
Edited to three stars since someone actually responded. Sent a ticket and awaiting further response regarding the issue of automatic image compression that cannot be turned off.	feature request

By dropping sms support they killed any and all functionality. I'm not going to keep a separate app on my phone for the 4 people who didn't delete their account.

The app is ok. When I first got it it worked perfectly fine but now It doesn't just one year later! It lags and won't let me send videos! I can send pictures and messages but for some odd reason I can't send a 4 minute video! My parents won't let me use messages or anything so this is the only app I can use and it is messed up!

I love it.. Because I'm only using it to text someone In Cuba. But the only issue I have is that it will work very well, and then it will tell me that my message has not been sent. If the number where I am sending is international to put a (+) following the area code & #. But I've done both and still nothing. AND then after it will work again and then stop again. Like either stop working or stop saying i need to put the (+) and area code. It doesn't work either way. So ugh. It that could get fixed. 5 star.	bug report

I'm unhappy with this app. I've had continuous problems with bugs including phone call and message notifications not coming in even when I open the app, sometimes the notifications are delayed by several hours and that's caused problems with important calls. The customer support is friendly but they've always told me to do a "clean uninstall" which hasn' fixed anything, and I've done that a few times. Another bug, my phones main speaker stops working after a phone call until I restart my phone.	bug report
Sometimes I don't get my text messages right away in a lot of calls get dropped	bug report
Lately have been getting expiring number alerts despite using it the day before. Edit: the issue was related to accidentally making a second account and getting that account's alerts on the one I'm actually using. Support resolved my issue in under an hour.	feature request

Works ok but you may not receive calls when your not on wifi.	bug report
Doesn't showcase calls and messages even though I set it for my default calling and text message receiver. I have to specifically go to the app and by then it's too late.	bug report
I was an avid user from 2015/2016 to now, and i can confidently say this new update sucks. Its terrible. I cannot get used to it at all. If they were going to update, then it should've been with more options for nitro or more options for call activities and not this.	feature request
Great in theory. Works amazing if everyone has the signal app. However if people have any other app (and many do) then it is unreliable for delivery and has weird restrictions on what can be sent (photos, gifs, and video have tons of trouble)	feature request
The most worst app ever! I cannot even reply my friends messages and I always need to leave from the app and then I can reply to them.	bug report
Man, I love and use discord religiously. AND THEY FIXED IT, WOOOOOO GOOD JOB BROTHERS	irrelevant information
I've been using this app for a while, and I've enjoyed it. However, with this new update, it's been a pain. I can't tell if my messages are sending. Sometimes, I can't switch conversations. I have to close the app to open a different conversation. Please fix these issues.	bug report
At times the application will not let me send a text. I've had to uninstall the application several times & takes several attempts in order for the application to work properly. The sound quality is not that great with an echo on both ends of a call & some times the sound will completely go out. If these issues were fixed this would be an excellent application.	bug report
Voice message never play.	bug report
It works it's just not the best.it has to many adds and it can't even let me call any one	bug report

I've been using signal since 2015 and it used to be good but now half of the time I don't receive messages and calls notifications. And the phone does not even ring on calls. I'm searching for an alternative app now.	bug report
This app expires the phone number after you give it out. If you are planning to use this on a regular basis as a permanent number to text from keep looking this app is not for you. They cancelled my number after I gave it out as a contact number that people could text me. Also I decided to try paying for it so I could maintain my number and now I can't login ....	bug report
Great WIFI Calling FREE app.	irrelevant information

It used to be good. Now you have to pay to receive otp texts? Why? What's the point?	bug report
I've been using Discord since the beta, and this ui makes it so much harder, not to mention all the bugs when I will type multiple and send multiple lines of the same text, and the only way to fix it is if you close and restart discord. Give us an option to revert back.	feature request
There are a lot of bugs	bug report
its a pretty good app to send text messages. making phone calls is sketchy. have to have full wifi,, and even with that, calls are not good. I have to check my phone to see if anyone has called or left messages,, Phone will not ring 90 percent of the time,, and will not notify me I have a text??? Very much a pain. It is free,that is about the only good thing about this app.	bug report
As of the current UI redesign, I would encourage not using the mobile app because it runs much much worse Tham before. The UI feels more closed behind more taps than before and things are taking like 1-4 seconds longer.	bug report
Awesome clarity, great app	irrelevant information
Text free is an awesome alternate to 'lame stream' carriers.. I had one issue & Jess helped me fix it in minutes.. no robots, no hold.. no problem. Two huge thumbs-up.. :)	irrelevant information

I've been using the app for many years, but this new UI is completely bugged. Why not having a new interface, but next time make it STABLE before production!	bug report

I've never really had a issues on Discord but now all the sudden when I try to talk with my friends and I table out if they can't hear me while I'm doing something else on the phone. Like it makes it very inconvenient because you have to stay tabbed on the app in order for them to hear you.	bug report
Awful update. Literally why	bug report

Very slow keeps freezing	bug report
rate your experience for how easy to the app	irrelevant information
Discord had a good mobile app... until they started rolling out a new UI. It's incredibly unintuitive to use; why are there tabs that separate dms and servers now? Why is there no universal, server-wide search? It's also slow, with noticeable chugging when I switch between messages in a server and a dm, and dropped frames when scrolling. No other app on my phone behaves like this. Finally, the default black theme is incredibly harsh on my eyes, making it hard for me to even use it.	feature request
I received some pornographic pictures from someone I don't know. I cannot get this person off. I will be deleting the GroupMe app if I can't get this person off. Hiding her is not enough. Until this happened I would have given 5 stars. Now I don't even want to give it any stars.	bug report
i'll rate it to 4 stars because when i call my friends they don't here me but i can here them. but please fix this bug,and this app is cool tho	bug report
Very good App, works perfect with headphone(better) or without	irrelevant information

CHANGED LAYOUT CHANGE IT BACK FREAKS	feature request
It's a good idea, but it is a pain in the butt to deal with. I don't know of this happens to you, but when I make a call, I can't hang up. And that's a huge problem, especially if I misclick the call button. The app can be rather slow at times and occasionally won't send messages. It's also slow to receive messages too. It would be neat if they implemented a feature to see if someone was typing or if someone had viewed a message that you sent. But the app is good if you don't feel like paying for a phone line and it also gives you a free number.	bug report
dosent even work i tried to call wouldnt work FIX THIS	bug report
It works now, thank you for fixing the issue apparently the old layout doesn't work properly anymore but another issue is the video chat and calls don't connect on mobile, it's been a problem for awhile for me.	bug report

I wish I can move the little box of my picture around to different location on the screen instead of a default position on the top right. Sometimes when people talk, there are things that more important at that location that I want to see instead of my face there. I hope you would take this into consideration. Viber does let the users move it around anywhere on the screen. Please check them out.	feature request
It's a good way to connect with friends, but my phone doesn't ring when somebody sends a message	bug report
Disappointed because I've been using this app for a long time now and for a while now you can no longer receive verification codes, which kind of defeats the purpose of some of the app. It only gives people at a disadvantage even less opportunities.	bug report
If there's more theme colour it will be great otherwise good	feature request
Love that you can have a permanent second number as long as you use the number you'll always have it you can log in any phone and have access to your phone number and contacts also you can used this app with Wi-Fi meaning off you don't have a SIM card you can still use your textnow number I ove this app	feature request
New update makes me where i cant get into my account. I have to make another account. I have important text messages on there i need.	bug report
It says that you can use it for free, but if you want to use all the good stuff, you have to purchase the service and activate your phone with the account and etc. If I had the random sim cards laying around still, I would have tried to activate one, but I have no reason to pay for this service when I have a phone already even though I don't want to keep this phone because it's got a BUG PROBLEM!!

I love using discord but rn i want to know why there is so many freaking ads. Like i can be writing a text and all of a sudden I'm hit with a ad. And sometimes when this happens with the ads, it deletes whatever i had written out. It's making me a bit aggravated because usually there is no ads at all whatsoever on discord.	bug report
Amazing app. But now it's not showing my texts I send to other people. Please fix this!! Okay I made this comment on 07/12/23 and it's still not being fixed...so I'm going down to a 1 out of 5 star review. It was a 5 out of 5. If you fix this it will go back up. Thank you and have a lovely day.	bug report
The AI is best, bit not a single option for free prompt on midjourney.	feature request
Freezes sometimes. Others in the group also mention the freezing or slugishness of the app. Had thought about moving to another app because of these issues. Other then that its at least a nice option to use. We are heavy users and maybe it just can't handle our demands on the system.	bug report
Too much spam	irrelevant information
My discord went back to normal for a few days but then instantly changed back, I would like it if I could turn off the auto update since the new update is really bothering me. If you can fix this then thank you very much	feature request
I am cancelling my recurring donation to Signal. Seamless SMS convinced my entire family to use it. Now I have no use for signal. To remove SMS makes Signal no different from of 100s of other encrypted chat apps. I have read the blogs, I have read the technical reasons. You are correct, it will be more secure. Is it better to be absolutely secure with no users? Or less secure with tens of millions of users? Is it really better to be right and dead? Good luck, but I'm not staying to find out.	irrelevant information
The new UI is slower and harder to navigate. Notifications are often wrong and it's harder to figure out where the notification is leading to. Switching between DMs and server messages takes significantly more taps and I have to use more of the screen to navigate. Information about who's online is now only available by tapping the top of the screen or navigating to an entirely different screen. The ability to access information about who's available has now been replaced by a swipe reply.	feature request

The Android experience is leagues behind anything else Discord is putting out. The app is laggy when performing most actions other than sending plaintext messages, and connection is entirely lost sometimes requiring me to restart my phone.

The recent Discord update has left many users dissatisfied, primarily due to a variety of changes that have disrupted the user experience. One of the major concerns is the revamped interface, which some argue is less intuitive and user-friendly compared to the previous version. The new layout and design alterations have led to confusion among users, hindering their ability to navigate the platform.	feature request

Good so far. Will update my opinion after further use.	irrelevant information
I really appreciate the app and like having it at my fingertips.	irrelevant information
The perfect messaging app. Elegant, simple, with messaging and privacy core at its design. I got sick of whatsapp as it keeps ballooning up with more features turning it into a bastard child of snapchat and youtube. I love signal, especially its clean design and excellent voice quality. Go for it.	irrelevant information

Absolutely adore the people I've met on this app as long as I've had it. But the new layout? Worst decision for the app. It sucks trying to get around now cause WAYYYY too much stuff got changed that literally wasn't needed. Old layout was much better.	feature request

Always a bad conection an call drops soon as you answer the phone flustrated but it free can't complain	bug report
Text messages are shown as sent on the other person's phone but don't show up on mine until hours later, my messages don't go through to theirs at all sometimes, calls won't show up as a notification on mine or theirs, and sometimes they connect but there's no audio. Textfree is a much better alternative, because none of that ever happened when I used it.	bug report

I cannot recommend this app whatsoever! The very first day of trying to register its automated police accused me of violating terms of our agreement before i had even registered!

Does not download as a proper app icon on my samsung, so have to go on line and find, install and log in everytime!!! General format quiet annoying. Calls are ok, but expensive.

This is a better way to keep a running group text thread going instead of searching through all your previous text messages.	feature request
Frustrating app! I don't get notified until hours (sometimes DAYS) after somebody has texted or called me. That's my biggest issue. Also, app ALWAYS glitches and shuts down whenever Im on it. Calls get cut off every time. Ill be on the phone, and suddenly it just randomly ends every 5 minutes for no reason. Also, Ads start randomly blasting while im mid-call, to the point where the person on the other end can hear, too. Super annoying.	bug report
Interesting app. Easy group or private text/chat.	irrelevant information
This app is good but if any phone call is connected while the skype call is on we can't hear back the voice after the phone call is disconnected. We have to disconnect the call and dial them back which is the only option. This is lingering and apps getting hanged sometimes though the network is good. Not sure what could be the reason. Voice call and call ring quality is not upto the mark. This works wonderfully in WhatsApp but lags here in skype	bug report
The app is definitely hormonal!!	irrelevant information
the new update is so bad. i cant even open someones camera full screen on call, it takes 50 clicks to work. and when i go to another app it turns off their camera and i ahve to rejoin to reconnect it. the servers and chats being on different tabs are annoying and you cant swipe to see people in a chat anymore either. the new update makes me want to delete the app and never use it again. every single thing just got so much more complicated than it needs to be. bring the old discord back	bug report

Right after logging in comes a contact sync page where none of the two links, or the one toggle button to opt out of synching, are functional. Restarting the app doesn't help. That's malice, not incompetence. The app is unusable if I don't let it sync contacts. That error wouldn't be made by a big corpo, and would be fixed quickly if it were.	bug report

Functional, private and without that WhatsApp feeling that makes you feel like your friends are visiting you at work when you're talking to them.

Everyone always complains of an echo when I call them.	bug report
Its a good app very helpful when you can't afford a phone plan, easy to use, awesome they offer a full service for a dollar. Cons: doesn't always tell you when you get calls or texts you just see a missed call sometimes that doesn't even show up and hard to hear the otherside during a call cuts out or drops quite frequently. I do appreciate the app overall! Thank you to the people who created it I understand its an adjustment with the ads, etc. but Hey! for a free app you guys did great! Thx:)	bug report

Poor usability. First it wanted to access my phone contacts, which I do not like. Then, I tried to connect with someone sitting across from me, but neither of 7s were able to figure out how to do that. Other messenger apps feature convenient search methods like usernames, QR code scanning or proximity scanning. Not this one. Also, I tried to install it on my computer, but the Linked devices step failed with an unhelpful "Network connection failed" error, even though I was definitely online.	bug report

Great app. Devs added unwanted features to divide things into categories that shouldn't have been moved. Also you made a server based architecture and then have the default page as messages.

everytime closed can't open	bug report
Love Discord on desktop, but the app is getting worse. Several of my settings I can't access because they open in a tiny window that's impossible to resize or move. I can't send voice messages, cause I have to "hold to record" and then there's no way to send, cause it's "release to cancel" and I can't press the send button cause then I'd have to release first. It's the most infuriating loop and it feels so intentionally infuriating.	feature request

UPDATE Oct 2023: NO FIX YET, NO CHAT BACKUP SINCE 8 MONTHS, DISAPPOINTED (5 start - 1 star) . The app 'was' great. However, since the last couple of updates the backups are failing. I get a message saying "Backup failed - Your recent backup could not be created and verified. Please create a new one." Before this the backups used to get stuck at 99.9% and would stay there, resulting in overheating of the phone. I'm using Samsung galaxy S20+.

Ever since the new update, everything has gone downhill. I had no issues with the previous layout, but now that this update has been brought around, it's messed up everything for me. Audio doesn't get transmitted through my headphones, some people (regardless of what I do) can't hear me, and overall the new layout/update is soooooo confusing. Maybe I'm just used to the old one, but I hate this update. ATLEAST give us an option on layout.	feature request

Thank you for making this app more difficult to navigate. Edit: I wish you had not made it an involuntary update to change the layout. I have my 2 cents in the settings where it asked for my opinion on the new layout. Edit: if you'd be happy to help, make the UI change optional.	feature request

For whatever reason, sending images has been acting up a lot over the last few months.

I've had zero issues across three phones, and I believe in my constitutional right to privacy. Just download it already. Should come default in my opinion. Edit: Had to lower my rating due to the announcement of dropping SMS support. Now I have to maintain two apps just to send messages. The unified UX that I got using Signal as SMS, and secure messaging, and the labels to let me know which messages were secure, was more than enough for me. Sad to see it go.	feature request

My app finally updated when I wasn't looking and hell, people weren't over reacting with the new UI changes. Discord is actively making the interface harder to use, the biggest change is the removed swipe to side features in place of having to press multiple buttons now instead to get where you want.

Excellent private services that don't give out your phone number to buyers like meta n twitter... no.1 for a reason.. open source so can be audited	feature request
This app switched so fast I want old TextNow back cause they make you pay just to send verfications that's why I'm quiting TextNow	bug report

Skype used to work but on mobile it's complete trash. I get calls but I can never answer, I can't call, and I can't message. It's always saying ''connecting" Even though my WiFi is at full bars. I'm very disappointed	bug report
Very buggy these days - swapping between apps causes the video on either end of callers to stop showing at all :(	bug report
Good app but need more work. First the lag. I can type or call someone without spamming my phone. Second the phone number. If you dont use it for a while it gives you a new number and I use the number I get for verification and when I get a new number whatever I used for a verification with the old number is now gone. Thanks a LOT.	bug report

This place is a scam I bought a sim card over 2 weeks and there is no way to get a hold of someone to help you activate your card. Then you check the sim card and the app says somebody is already using it.!!. FU#K Y@U	irrelevant information

Overall a very good app for group messaging, however, direct messages can be a little quirky. I find that I do no get notifications when I get a the first direct message from someone. I'm hoping this will eventually be fixed	feature request
you can' use this app without a phone #.	feature request
The functionality of the new update is infuriating. It's slower, the color options are awful, and the DM vs Server pages is so much more difficult to use. Seriously, why	feature request
Never had any problem	irrelevant information
Don't like the calling, messes up alot.	bug report
App works perfectly fine there are no bugs but one thing that bothers me is that they should add a feature of pausing a voice message while recording.	feature request
I can never hear the person on the other line and/or it does not allow the other person to hear me. 8 out of 10 times it will hang up on its own mid conversation or it will not hang up at all and will not allow me to end a conversation in which case i will have to reset my phone to fix such problem. Other than that, the texting I've had no problems with thus far, and its a blessing and much appreciated to have such an app when I need to use it..	bug report
Useful for a variety of different groups. Kids, sports, Scouts, etc.	irrelevant information
Makes you get a account eventually. At least to my prior experience.	irrelevant information
It was great, but now I never get my texts', even when I log in! I have to refresh the app or force stop it an log back in to receive text, fix please! This is my only way of communication with the outside world! Lol	bug report
Wish they had a paid version without ads and a way to edit the vibration alert setting, And a way to disable screen wake up when you get a new message	feature request
Great app to stay included	irrelevant information
Usually I don't leave reviews but this has me so upset that I actually came to leave one, the new update has so many problems it's ridiculous. The one particularly annoying one is that it freezes on one channel in a server or conversation and you have to restart the app to fix it, then you back and there's like 20 Spam messages of the same thing. The old version was better and didn't need to be fixed imo. üòí It's fine on desktop tho the app is just bleh.	bug report
The desktop version is fine but the new mobile version is horrendous, it's so hard to navigate.	feature request
Great concept for users who need a 2nd phone number but dont want to spend an arm and a leg with more traditional services. That said, the call quality/reliability is horrible even with strong wifi connectivty. I have no issue with other apps like skype or google voice, but one phone call dropped 4 times with textfree and cut out 50% of the time or more. The ads are also annoying. I would recommend one of the many other apps on the market, same service but better quality	bug report
It's been a 5 star app for over a year but this latest update to an uglier "balloon" style UI comes with massive bugs. I have to close the app and reopen to see other channels inside my server and sometimes even doing that won't work. Your basic navigation is broken and buggy with this past update. If it wasn't for the desktop app, I would have to stop using it. It might be time to look for another platform.	bug report
Please reply soon! How do I join on PS5 after this update?!?! The button is gone!!!	bug report
I like it very much. I love it that my phone doesn't go off non stop from regular group text. It's all in the app and I can choose when to check it üíñ	irrelevant information
This will always be in my phone but,Can someone Call collect on this app	feature request
Messaging works well for me, but switching menus and the like is difficult; it lags and freezes which sometimes causes other issues. I can join calls, but I can't hear anyone so it's completely pointless.	bug report
The new update sucks! They seperated servers and messsges. They made a whole bunch more steps too see who is in the server. They just made everything inconvinient! The only good thing about the update is Midnight mode.	feature request
Lately I was told that the telephone lines to Sweden were cranky and they could not hear me properly. Could you take care of this problem. Thanks.	bug report
Every time i turn around it force closes to the point i have to uninstall the app and reinstall it to get it to work. I dont always get my messages and it doesnt always ring when i get a call. I have done plenty of trouble shooting and i am sure my phone needs an unavailable software update but your app should work on every phone if you want to be considered any good. I had a previous phone break on me and it worked better on that phone but still had issues.	bug report
You needs to keep refreshing to get new texts but other that that its a good app	bug report
whenever i opened the app through the notif drawer it would endlessly be connecting, sometimes the keyboard would glitch out too, but overall pretty good	bug report
Bad experience...not working good. It's not not sending massages, not uploading my photos, always showing connection error or check connection.	bug report

Ok beside load slow had problem so do not try it again yet but I will	bug report
When you make calls it doesn't start ringing.	bug report
I used to love discord but ever since the recent updates it sucks. It no longer sends out notifications, it freezes constantly, and calls disconnect if you so much as touch your phone. And that's if you can get the app to open without your phone saying theirs a bug that won't allow you open the app. It closes you out frequently for no reason. When it works I love the setup and how easy it is to talk to my friends but it's to hard right now	bug report
Great app. Easy to use. Have to completely close the app to edit roles though. Super buggy on that aspect.	bug report
It does it's job as well as group texts except easier to add or remove people without having to start new groups.	feature request

Other than some delays in receiving text but oh boy when its comes to making or receiving calls its just a nightmare	bug report
I loved this app but recently it started crashing whenever I opened up a text chain! Plz fix	bug report
Just as private and encrypted as the app claims. And it also features video calling and voice calling. It is just like messenger, but with a hell of a lot more security. If I could afford the premium then I would. But yes all the features of messenger except for the big Jew nose of Zuckerberg sniffing away at your privacy!!!!!!!!! Thanks signal private messaging team! I will definitely have to spread the word on my onlyfans channel! Do you guys have any stickers or help with marketing?	irrelevant information
I've been using Skype since before Microsoft and I'm amazed at how low the app has fallen (PC version too). In the latest installment of "things going wrong", if you dare switch the app while on a call, the whole system falls apart. It creates a weird dual window setup with a random app and if you make the mistake to kill that, you lose access to the application and also your back gesture. Force stopping the app is the only way out of that. Seriously, do something about this thing!	bug report
Not cool removing SMS support, I used signal as my primary and now have to go back and forth just isn't worth keeping signal anymore, I loved the fact I was able to send pics and videos to iPhone user who didn't have android and it not get Pixelated or compressed is what made me switch to signal especially when the network became an issue not receiveing or sending my regular messages because of being in limbo with wifi and the network until I switched to signal.	feature request

This is really a great app, for free calling and text messages, you can't go wrong. There is only a bug or two once in a while,, which every app has. You don't only get to make FREE calls you also get your own telephone number. Yep, it's all about TEXT NOW, and believe me, LATER TOO!	feature request
Lately, voice chat hasn't been working every time I get on, it'll say connecting indefinitely and never connect me. It'll only work if you have mobile data, which sucks because where I live, thr mobile data would die for no reason. Fix this mistake	bug report

This app is kinda poor, messages don't deliver even if there is a good network and the data is turned on. You can see that someone is online on WhatsApp, and the messages sent on signal is not delivered, so the person has to open the signal app before the message can be delivered, that's very poor.	bug report

This is an excellent app to use for Craigslist, Internet Ads, giving strangers your number who you potentially may never speak to again. I have used to text and call so my real phone number isnt out there works great! Only bad thing to say about it why I only give it 4 stars is the Ads, you have to deal with a huge ad in the way of the keyboard and it's very annoying. You have to deal with ads on Pandora, YouTube, Photo Ediditng Apps, even scrolling through websites and here too.	feature request

Sometimes messages do not sync until I open the app. Same on the other end of the chat using IOS. Same battery settings as WA. otherwise I would rate it 4/5	bug report
This software is great and I've been using it as my primary messaging app for years. Everyone should be encrypting their text messages and this makes it easy. Unfortunately, the developers made the choice to remove SMS capabilities (despite feedback from the community), which severely limits how I can use it, who I can use it with, and makes it hard to recommend to friends (who probably also have multiple messaging apps installed already).	feature request
Very, disappointed in both this and the other Text Free apps,was unable to connect on sign in with either,kept getting messages to correct time she time and date were both already correct deleted both apps.	bug report

Just use Skype. Ive have mobile discord for years (2020)and the fact that the volume is set so low that max volume in the app and max volume for phone while its in speakers is so quiet. If two people try to talk on mobile it's impossible. Then it stops working. No indication that there's any issues but it'll be quiet and you can't hear or talk to them so you have to stop and restart.

I love this app, me and my friends use it all the time, but I hate that only iPhone can use emojis to describe the channels and catagorys, yes its not that big of a deal, but I hate having to get my friends to help me because of it. Sometimes it can get really annoying and frustrate me, I don't think it's really fair, and I would enjoy it if we could use emojis as an Android/Samsung users.

There's a big problem with adding video from Android devices.  The app will send the video you uploaded but when complete the proportions are wrong.  The video will have the same width but the height looks to be shrunk by at least half if not more.  Can't even tell what the video is after this happens.    I'll change my rating to 5 stars once this is fixed because everything else about this app is awesome.    PS. Also allow us to change our avatars separately in each group chat.  Some group chats (for school or work) require a normal headshot while other laid back group chats, we may want to put a funny picture as our avatars.  So we should be able to change our picture in the same drop-down menu where we can change our nickname  Thank you	feature request

SMS removal makes it complicated on which app I need to use to message someone. No way to know if someone has signal or not. I end up sending SMS more often than Signal messages. This change makes you use the insecure path for messaging. Their decision to drop SMS support forces me to use SMS for everything instead of secure messaging. Defeats the whole purpose of their app existence.	feature request

App works good for communication but lately been having problems connecting and posting messages	bug report
This is one of the worst messaging apps ever. I can not believe it has so much market share. Everything breaks constantly. Through multiple reinstalls, I still can't even properly tag people or add people to groups or even start a new direct message because the search completely glitches out every time I try to use it. Now the notifications have broken and opening them doesn't even bring me to the message in question. Videos and pictures also fail constantly.	bug report
This new UI doesn't work and is worse in every single aspect. Revert it and leave it alone please	bug report
I dislike the new UI update. I'm aware that changes often take some getting used to, so despite immediately disliking it, I gave it a couple weeks to get used to it. I've now adapted, but it's still bad. It's worse than the previous layout, it requires more taps to get anywhere, and navigating the app is still less intuitive than before. There's one search bar to search within a channel and another to search a whole server, which is just inconvenient. It's pretty slow and breaks often too.	feature request
New UI sucks so much, roll it back please	feature request

love the app but PLEASE fix the issue with messages not going through until the app is opened. I often miss messages, don't get notified, open the app and then get a bunch of notifications from 20+mins ago. Extremely annoying issue. Happening to two of my friends as well. As if app needs to be running for messages to get through. But doesn't update in background. Not a settings problem on our phones, so it's a problem with the app. Also, give us the option to record video without holding in.	bug report

Please, do not be stylistically similar to Messenger, do not blindly follow them in UX way, because stylistically Signal was way better in my opinion. Revoke the possibility where for each contact I was able to set a color and it was respected in the chats as well, it was very convenient and I valued Signal very much for that. Please, always add the possibility to customize the application more while proceeding such changes with Signal updates. The new chat configuration seems to be very advanced and cool, but right after performing it I was searching like crazy for a option in the application settings, maybe a checkbox, saying "respect the interlocutor message color in group chats", and also for a possibility to change the color of the interlocutor's messages in the conversation settings aside of mine messages only. Aside of that it is a very good application for people who value their own privacy, and want to have secure conversations. Probably the best stock SMS app replacement.	feature request
listen stop what your doing. This app is amazing it works extremely well and it actually does what the description says. Times are hard right now and with prices rising and money hard to come by it's been very helpful for keeping in touch with others.	irrelevant information

Can we get an option to have the old UI. The new one is much worse. Why make it different to the PC version and change controls so any intuitive or learnt controls are different and the app is now much slower and less responsive with multiple bugs and issues and there has been no fixes or communication about updates.	feature request
Removal of SMS support kills the all-in-one utility of this app for me.	feature request

Never rings and notifies you that someone's called until you open the app. All my settings are turned on and still no ring . I keep missing super important calls and I'm going to have to delete TextNow due to this reason . It only rings 20% of the time , while it NEVER rings or notifies you for the other 80%. The only texting/calling app that I have constant problems with. I will be finding a different app and will never recommend to anyone else for as long as this issue is ongoing .	bug report

I like the app, but lately I've been having issues regarding voice recording through android auto. It does not let me record a voice message more than a second, than it starts a call that does not exist and cannot be ended, which causes an audio or music to not be able to play. When I am able to record a voice message somehow, the quality is incredibly bad. I don't know if it's because the integration between them is not yet alright, though this kind of becomes frustrating.	bug report

Usually good, but I have a major complaint about the newest version of the mobile app. Newest update makes it to where you can't just swipe over to see the user list (e.g., who is in a server, who is online, etc). I can't think of a legitimate reason why that would have been changed, but I'm really hoping Discord reconsiders this decision.	feature request
DO NOT USE THIS APP! I Used this app for 6 months and then all of a sudden i couldnt get onto my app. I am a digit nomad and i travel to many places around the world so i have a need of being able to receive texts via internet. All of my accounts including email, bank and government websites all are to be accessed using sms verification OTP through this number, and i cant get i to any account !

I like signal. Seems secure. I can see all images in one place. I wish it would group all url links together too. You can search chat history. Works well between iOS/Android. 2 stars because 1) I can't use/download signal on my android samsung tablet. 2) I can't hang up voice calls or turn off speaker. I have to ask other person to hang up. When you leave signal during a call, and return, it takes you to chat/main menu, and can't return to signal call view. It has been a few months, not fixed	feature request

Not gonna lie, I do like this update. But making servers is harder now and the new things added are just completely useless to the app. Ive been on discord for years and I've never disliked it. It can keep the overall look but the server making needs to go back to its normal way.	feature request

It was alright before they had been intentionally dumping SMS messages. Won't be using it as my default messaging app going forward and won't be supporting them financially or recommending the app anymore.

Signal is excellent. I prefer it over more commonly used messenger apps. The interface is uncluttered & doesn't weave itself through your OS. The biggest attraction for me is the encryption feature. Other messenger services are woefully lacking & are vulnerable. Signal does a good job at resolving these issues & as long as they stick to the double ratcheting end-to-end encryption thats only viewable to the poster & receiver... it will remain my go-to messenger service. Don't screw it up.	feature request
Handy and useful, like texting, but different.	irrelevant information

Works well. Have some issues trying to connect from/to Skype for business.	bug report
Why does it buffer when I open the app but won't show me any of my texts? Also, why does it make me keep force stopping the app? I'm tempted to uninstall if I didn't need it so much. And no, it is NOT my wifi or data connection. It is your APP and I think it needs a deep, thorough cleaning.	bug report
I swear the audio and call clarity gets worse with every update. Stop advertising Nitro. Stop telling me to change my username. Please secure and backup server content. Exhausting.	bug report

Honestly, it's going downhill with every update. Calls drop out of nowhere, camera will sometimes just stop working and wont switch or be able to go off camera,after the call drops it shows your status as unavailable so the person cant call you back, speaker will go off at random times or just wont allow you to go on. It also doesn't display the time when the call drops or when a message has been sent. It's such a shame that the developers sacrificed the functionality for a prettier UI, that has also gotten more complicated and its obvious it's trying to imitate other social media interfaces. It saddens me a lot since I use the app to communicate with my boyfriend and between this and WhatsApp, I'd rather use this but may change my mind.	bug report

Too annoying when it comes to screen sharing, it kept on asking for "Start Recording with Discord..." thing every time I switch my screen's orientation (from portrait to landscape, and vice versa).

Discord for android used to be good, now with the new layout I cannot find anything, how do I get out of the server and see my friends list, or is there a way to get the old layout back? The app overall is good but I cannot navigate it. I also don't have too many network problems, although sometimes I send a message and I don't see it in a channel, no anyone elses messages.	feature request
I gave it 3 stars, reason being that the report system is a bit faulty. My account got disabled even though I was above the age requirement and they gave no warning at all and disabled my account. Now they're asking for a Photo ID with my birth date as well as a selfie of mine which kinda invades my privacy. Hopefully they enable my account again as I've had multiple friends on it which are now completely gone.	bug report

Discord was excellent but the recent forced changes are unintuitive, frustrating and less accessible. Everyone is overwhelmingly unhappy and the response has been to just deal with it. Please provide an option to revert the interface. I feel like I'm fighting with the app to keep track of messages and use basic features. The dark mode colour hurts my eyes. Whoever made these changes evidently does not use the app or care about discords users.	feature request
theres a severe lagging issue during a call it seems like there's a few seconds before the other person can hear you while you're talking and the phone will freeze when incoming calls are coming in, it will not allow the page to drop down so you can accept the call ..also the notification sound will not alert when a text message comes in..

UPDATE: After being contacted by a friend by email, i found out they couldnt get text messages through. I just found TextNow took my phone number because it was "inactive". This was done even though I PAY for the subscription every month, which one of the things that was supposed to do was KEEP the Same Number. If I cant keep my number, than this app is useless to me. As if it was the only number people had, and my number changed, they wouldnt be able to contact me. So im canceling.	bug report

Messages refuse to send, messages don't show up even with a notification, constantly crashing, the new update looks terrible and has been extremely buggy with loading, when I open a chat it puts me at a random point in the chat from days ago and not at the bottom where current messages are.

Dissapointed to have to change my review. The new update is a total mess. Their website says that it was meant to be a more dedicated mobile experience and make everything 'smoother and streamlined'. It sure is one of the mobile apps of all time. It does neither smooth nor streamlined however. Every passing update is a clunkifying nightmare due to the designer's lack of understanding as to what their own app is used for. Being a shoddy ios to android port certainly doesn't help it either.	feature request

it does what it says it does: you get a phone number for texting and calls over Wi-Fi. the only thing I have negative to say about it, if you can even call it "negative", is the fact that you can lose your number if you go too long without texting or calling via the app. I wish it just asked "do you Still want to keep this number?" if it's been a while since it's been used... not make you use it or take the number away. other than that, no problems.	feature request

Text Free is a great app if you need a disposable number. It allows you to search for a number using words. For example I have a number that is XXX-XXX-VAPE. The only thing I don't like is the unnecessary notifications. I could see if it was for ads but it's not. They keep reminding me of features I don't need or want. Other than that a great app and worth it for an additional number to use but 4 out of 5 stars because of it.	feature request
Fun way to find community and talk to new people	irrelevant information

i like that you can text some people that you keep in touch with, but you can't call them cause it costs money and some people may not recieved your text because they have a different device	feature request

Well, it used to be good. It was the only app that wouldnt transfer from my old phone, and now it wont allow me to text to anyone who wasnt in a previous group even tho i allowed my contacts. i basically vant do anything with it and i had go go to the play store to delete the app. I deleted my account.	bug report

Have been using the app for a long time, but the updates keep making it worse. The ui keeps getting worse, while the new features, while neat, don't add that much value to me personally. I've resorted to turning off auto update and praying my current version doesn't break, around update 116 was peak discord.	feature request

Not only is this a trashy copy of "trendy" UI, but there are text sizing issues on the DMs screen, message whitespace/gap issues, and my friends constantly say I randomly sound like I'm underwater regardless of settings. Just overall so unbelievably buggy. Now the mobile app isn't even consistent with the design of the desktop app. Navigation is so bad now. Too many taps to get to diff menus instead of swiping like before. Messages moved to the bottom??? Yeah, no. Revert the update. ASAP.	bug report

Works swiftly and much larger file limitations than built-in SMS/MMS app. HOWEVER, removal of SMS support (rather than only supporting Signal to Signal messaging) was a MASSIVE blow to the app. I understand that this feature was removed to ensure user privacy in all conversations, but we were already aware that Signal ‚ÜîÔ∏è SMS didn't have encryption; it was made very clear. Was a 5-star app. Now, a solid 2.5 -- might as well use Snapchat at this point since others HAVE to have a Signal account.	feature request

If there was any other Skype client for Android, I would switch to that one immediately. It's the worst mobile messaging app ever.

I wouldn't recommend this for people with not so good data plans I had it for a week and it used almost one gigabyte but it's good texting app over WiFi sometimes it doesn't send a message or you don't receive one which is a pain but it's good in that category	feature request

this used to be a 5 stars. I really tried to give their update some time, but it is just so awful, unintuitive, loss of ease of access. Incredibly buggy.

Latest release feels like they changed things just to change things. The old UI was way more intuitive and, more importantly, responsive.

Look, a lot of people are review bombing but this is genuinely a problem. The app feels a lot less accessible now, the share dialog is a busy unreadable mess now and things that used to be easy to do like sliding to see who was online or on the server are gone.

Great app. Incredibly useful until the fateful day it decides to randomly, without warning, RESET EVERYTHING and you can no longer access any message you've ever sent or seen.

This week I missed several notifications due to the app not alerting me even though alerts were set to on. I had to spend an hour working thru this issues these missed messages caused me. Lesson learned I cannot count on this app. This almost affected my grade in a bad way!	bug report
Discord is a powerful tool to have at your disposal, however the latest series of updates seems to have caused issues for many various users myself included. And what is suggested to do to alleviate these hard issues has not been working. Therefore I suggest caution and see if your particular device and OS are experiencing such issues.	bug report
Used the app for around 4 years, its nice. The new layout took some getting used to. A main problem have I is the swipe to reply being in the same motion as the edit text thing. Yeah its a lot faster, but annoying.	feature request

This app pretty much saved my life when it comes to being cut off from my previous carrier by toxic family, and not being able to afford another carrier. $2 for a SIM? Saved my life I KNOW I can pay to be ad-free, but I don't have an issue with ads. I have an issue with your add placement, and how ads pop up. It shouldnt even be legal for an add to pop up where my finger was just typing, moving my keyboard to open an ad. Now an ad is opening a new tab on my phone on its own? Fix placement.	feature request
i purchased lock in number and every week for the two months i had it, i would get a constant msg everyday every 10 mins saying..we're sorry but we are unable to process your payment...even though the payment would always come out of my account..i ended up cancelling because its annoying and its been over a month and im still getting the same msg plus a constant msg saying..dont lose your number to inactivity, eventhough i use my number all day everyday..	bug report

Call quality is good for the most part. I havent tried it with this latest update, however, before the update, calls would either drop, get staticky ot just not go through at all. Hopefully this app remedies that. Then you will get the fifth star.	bug report

Doesn't rotate camera. "Support" is some weird guy who thinks the solution to everything is uninstall, clear cache, reinstall old version from shady website, and use outdated unsecure drivers.

The only thing I have a problem with is for some reason I dont get notifications for one of my groups so I have missed important messages	bug report
The entire app just.. breaks. I'll open discord, try and call someone, and the call screen will just be smushed and half missing, and if I leave it, I then can't access the call screen at all. It then takes multiple restarts until it finally decides to load properly. This glitch also effects image loading. So, discord, I hope you learned that changing the UI which wasn't as broken to something worse was a horrible mistake which I hope you reconsider and change back to how it used to be.	bug report

Fairly good app with one main issue: App won't let me answer 50% - 75% of incoming calls. I have to decline the call (sometimes not allowed), or wait for caller to disconnect. Then I have to wait an unspecified amount of time (varies wildly) for a text to come in telling me that I missed a call and then the app will allow me to call them back! Please fix. Other issue is call stability if you're using Wi-Fi to connect during inclement weather.	bug report

Hate the new UI changes. The entire app, even switching channels in a server is far slower than before. Much more difficult to carry on two conversations than before	bug report
The call breaks when we are just talking and the games break or don't load in multi-player. I've been a long time fan of discord but it has so many issues. But there are many possibilities that could make this app better.	bug report
It's a scam Don't make any purchases they will sell all of your credit/debit card information they did it to me a couple days later, I had purchases I had never made on my card.	irrelevant information
Its not bad but I've tried to log back in to my account and says that It is invalid. Then I tried to make a new one says something about a new verification code and never sent it to me so I'm not sure if this is a bug or it is really backed up but I might not use it again	bug report
The new app update is horrible. It is bogging down my phone and it is showing the wrong chats constantly. It is also just crappier and slower.	bug report
It's like they're trying to kill the app. We don't need bs stories. We do need sms support.	feature request
Still need a lot of improvements and more features.	feature request
This app stinks I made a number and its not an actual number I can't sign up to any other app it always says invalid it really stinks!	bug report
For the most part it's a good app, I use it when my phone is off. So as long as I am near wifi, it serves its purpose. But right now I'm between jobs, so I've been relying on the app a little more. But my issue is that, even though I understand that you say it's for security reasons, I can't sign up for certain work apps cause I can't get the code unless I pay for the app. It's frustrating because sometimes I can get a code, then other times I can't.	feature request

I loveD Signal. Having an all-in-one app where I could have secure comms with other Signal users AND still text people who aren't (and never will be) users because they don't care about security was great. But with the end of SMS support, using Signal is a hassle. I have to think about whether a given friend is on Signal or not when I go to text them. This is a poor decision by the dev team - elevating best security over usability will just bleed users and make us all less secure in the long run	feature request

DND! Stream for free! Tried discord for dnd screensharing. It wasn't great, appearing that the shared screen would not update if not focussed on it (although this might have been the vtt) Went back to Zoom. Thought that would be the end! Now Zoom has 10min cool down per 40min call... Tentatively, I went back to Discord. Best decision ever. We now have places for group inventories, session notes, and general chat. Thanks Discord (and sorry we didn't give you a chance sooner!)	feature request
I never receive notifications until I open the app recently (I tried a ton of things to fox it, like disabling battery optimizations, with no luck). I'm also not a fan of the giant Skype button that was added to group chats. It's an eyesore and I think it would be better hidden in a menu.	feature request
While my phone is temporarily disconnected, my daughter to me to get Pinger so I can text to keep in touch with friends and family as long as I am in WiFi range. I thought Yay!

Incredibly inconsistent with Bluetooth headphones. I can only get my Bluetooth headphone mic to work when I test the voice sensitivity.	bug report
To bad that they are dropping support for sms in the app. Since so few still use signal, this will probably cause me to stop using signal and just use sms to everyone since it will be hard to convince anyone to use the app.	feature request
Listen. I love Discord. It's convenient and I've made new friends. But I despise this recent update. Everything is wrong! It's hard to navigate my stuff on mobile now. Personally, I think there should be a way to choose the format. I prefer the old format on Android, it was much easier to navigate and made everything better. I can have multiple conversations going on, and having to constantly go back is so much harder than just having a button.	feature request

Are dropping sms messages and this app will only work if other person has signal app also. A big mistake, most friends quit the app after notice and I will have to go to another message app so most of my contacts can get my texts. Was good until they told us dropping all sms apps.	bug report

The new layout ruined the app. It needs to be rolled back or at least make it optional, as it stands now the app is considerably more clunky and non-intuiative. It's just not really worth using in it's current state.	feature request

I won't even waste time to mention the chronic lags during chat nor the mis-synchronizations with other clients app on desktop etc. I can cope with that so far. But now a new frustration : each time I logout and choose the app to remember my login details, it systematically doesn't remember them and I have to put them back at logon. I remarked the same, but less systematic, behaviour on the destop client apps. You doesn't seem to be able to get any chat app right, do you ?	bug report
I used to love this app. Now they changed the interface and won't even let you change the colors back. This app has become genuinely painful on my eyes to use. I cannot use it for longer than five minutes at a time. All of the color options are too high contrast for anyone like me who may be sensitive to that. And since they changed the layout entirely at once, I'm running into double the bugs and glitches I used to, many that are frustrating enough to just shut down entire conversations.	feature request

I currently do not receive messages when they are sent and my messages are being sent. Messages go through like hours later. I also have issues with answeothe incoming calls. 2 out of 10 calls I can answer. I have to decline the call then call them back... Signal must have a challenge to see how long I can keep using them... üôÑ	bug report
Gosh the new update is awful. Half the time it doesn't function and only displays the same channel despite opening other ones even when changing servers. When you open DMs they are scrolled up 20 messages and need to scroll to see the most recent ones. The UI is confusing and doesn't make sense to just not keep the desktop one since I switch between the two regularly. Half thought out and a quarter developed 'update' that broke a perfectly working app and UI	bug report

However, the new UI update is absolutely awful; It's a hassle to navigate, makes things unnecessarily complicated and I have a sneaking suspicion that it is the cause of the new-found lag and slowness I experience when operating discord, however, I know that I will continue using discord to communicate will all my friends, create servers for my games and to talk to people about any topic I wish to.	feature request

Good mainly 4 texting. Call quality could b alot better as it often drops calls, breaks up voices & static. As far as sending & receiving pics, its 2 confusing. Need to b able 2 text the message first, then select a # 2 text.  Needs to be a bit more smaller in size bcuz it takes up alot of memory/space for such a simple app. Thier should be a compatible app for diff devices, such as tablets. Also maybe a bit more app settings too.	bug report

Pretty good app but now glitchy since the most recent update and "support" is a useless auto-reply. Would be 4 stars if not for the glitches and poor CS. No way to talk to a human. The auto-reply suggested my issues were due to not having the newest version 5.49.3 (I do)... My issue is: messages don't send or come in without me repeatedly resetting things by closing and reopening the app. Very frustrating. Using WhatsApp in the interim unless someone can actually help fix this for me.	bug report

While I have enjoyed using this app for many years, I am really disappointed by the recent UI update to the mobile app. It has only made using the app a clunkier, disjointed experience that is far too sudden of a switch from the previous UI. I have had auto updates turned off for a while now, due to many updates in the past that have made unnecessary changes that only make the app a hassle to use. I would love if Discord reverted back to their previous UI and listened to their userbase.	feature request
Used to be a lot simpler to use in the beginning, nowadays there are a lot more features, however I feel that most of them are hardly used and merely clog up the UI and slow down navigation, which makes the app harder to learn for new users. On top of this, the mobile app always seems really buggy, to where I often have to close and reopen it for things to load and display properly.	feature request
I'll remove the low rating if the app is changed back to being Skype instead of this wannabe something else. It used to be that I could see who of my contacts were online when logging in, now I get a list of old chats. When checking my contacts, I can't see who's online. Instead, this highlights garbage is being pushed on us. I don't want highlights, I want to see who of my contacts are online.	bug report

I want to give you more stars, I really do, but the new.UI needs to go. It's hideous, counter-intuitive, clunky and bugged.

Revert the UI, and stop asking me to update my username. I'm staying on v205.15 until the UI is fixed. I'm not interested in the help article that will "help me navigate the changes."

Ever since the update, this app has been failing me in so many ways and has become so confusing. It has become very difficult to maneuver the call feature where I could call or video chat friends has become almost impossible to use.

Not to mention, it just fully bugged out on me and no longer lets me open the call. Please change it back.	bug report
The "free" app comes at a steep price. This is my #1 bandwidth user for data, on cellular or Wi-Fi, as it constantly downloads ads.

Decent app, except that it seems to provide message notifications selectively. I and some friends in a couple groups have the same problem. The groups are not snoozed, and sometimes provide notifications and sometimes I get a text about something from the group and come to find that I wasn't getting notifications. This seems to be an issue that started over the last few months, can't recall having the problem before but I don't use GroupMe extensively.	bug report

It's been nearly two hours and no email so I was forced to try my secondary account which I also had to reset the password for, requested email and that one went through immediately. But now I find that I cannot receive verification texts at all unless I pay for service when I could receive them just fine on my other number before I got locked out. Now I can't verify an account I desperately need to access.	bug report

This app has been life saver. Being a single mother there were times the phone bill was last in line and the app is free. Of course you can pay for some convinces, but you can use it for texting and calling. Super easy to set up and easy to use. I'm using it over the mobile network I have and I can have those calls and messages routed through the app. Has been a reliable recovery for mobile use. Love it .	irrelevant information
Every time someone calls me my all UI stops working and it get hanged rendering the unavailability of my entire phone. I have the latest version using s23 ultra. Please resolve the issue.	bug report
Discord used to be pretty great. Recently, a lot of the interface updates have become very user-unfriendly and straight-up clunky. No one likes this new update. It's bugged and frustrating and unappealing. You've removed a great deal of smoothness from the navigation and it's ungodly frustrating. I just got a bug today where I tried to send an image to a server and it instead sent the image TO MY PRIVATE MESSAGES. Do you have any idea how bad that could be? Please listen to your userbase.	bug report
I keep getting kicked out of the app and I have to always sign in the stupid app	bug report
Used to be a good app, but now, aside from the not being able to type when discord is in split mode (a highly annoying addition in a previous update), but I feel navigating the app is very counter intuitive. I understand the swipe to reply, but I have to tap so many places and ways to get to things I need (like channel descriptions, pinned messages etc.). Also seeing who sent an unread dm is not that clear? It's not clear which of your chats is unread (only dms, not servers)	feature request
New interface is bad design.	feature request

This use to be a very cool app. Lately the call is delayed, dropped, or no audio on voice-mail. I've updated the app and its still not functioning better... I'm Uninstaller then reinstalling now. Hopefully this works. 08/19/2021- Community thank you for your resonse. Updated and much better.	bug report
they updated the design of the app and its so ugly now, dont even ask or lets you switch back	feature request
I would give it more stars but when your talking to a machine the dail tone scream and don't go anyway ruining the call. Please fix this	bug report
It really irritates me that I can't delete entries from the log. Many of my friends have security clearances and I like to be conscientious of that by cleaning up... This app does not allow for it that. Also a lot of calls get dropped before they even get answered	bug report
My experience with group me app has been exceptional!	irrelevant information
Signal used to be a great app with thr ability to send securely encrypted messages in addition to standard SMS messages. Very few people I know actually use the secure messaging feature, but it has been nice to have the easy option to encrypt with them. However, with the decision to abandon SMS support, I probably won't be using Signal any longer since it will be a niche product for times I really want encryption. They spent a lot of time, and money making the app approachable, all now wasted.	feature request
Keeps closing every time i open the app.	bug report
No notification sound or push when someone messages me. This feature was very important and useful to me. Now it's gone, I'm going to switch to whatsapp	bug report
Discord used to be great now its becoming even worse as days go on. Developers you have one job and that is to make a stable app that we can communicate. We don't ask for all this unnecessary garbage ui and updates. Untill this buggy app is fixed I can't give more the 1 star.	bug report
oh its great when it works. but almlst everytime i attempt to make a call and it fails, it get stuck on the dailer screen and then i would have to reboot my phone in order for it to close out the app.. ummm is there a fix for this? cause im bout to delete it.	bug report
I've used discord for a few years and I hate the new mobile ui, maybe give an option to choose what you prefer at least because the new layout stresses me out tbh the old one worked just fine.	feature request
IT IS LAG	bug report
Ever since the update, there is a notification that is glitching out. Contacted mods they don't know why. But every time i mark it as read, it shows up 4 minutes later, mute it still shows up, turn off notification nope still does it. This is the 1 notification that i had not read before the update, and now it will not go away.	bug report
Loved this app for a good long time. Uninstalled because it's not free if you need a verification code. A little misleading to give a "free number" that can't receive messages until you pay.	feature request
Very useful app with some extremely helpful features, though the latest layout change has made using it unintuitive and clunky. It used to have all features easily and smoothly accessible from a single page, however now there are several different pages that are more confusing to switch between and unpleasant to use consistently. Closing a chat is as easy as before but this adds to the confusion as you cannot reopen it the same way, which was previously possible. New dark mode is also inferior	feature request
Keeps kicking me out. Have Uninstaller and reinstalled multiple times. Very aggravating as this is our units communication method	bug report
Decent way for a group of people to communicate via text. One complaint I have is it is a little hard to upload pictures and videos. Also you can't upload long videos only short ones . Edit you can now upload videos up to 60 seconds long. Still can take quite a while to upload photos and videos.	feature request

So I've been using discord for probably about 2 years.

When i try to resize my profile pic it sends me to the crop screen but then it quickly abruptly sends me back to the previous screen with some error texts, please devs fix this.	bug report
Still buggy after many updates... For mobile users, discord holds numerous bugs when using the app. It usually corrects itself after closing and opening but this is happening almost after every action. I'm on a note10...	bug report
This app used to be good. New layout Is horrible. Messages get stuck or won't show unless refresh app constantly. Some times it's split and only shows half a message or half a picture.	bug report
I think they should fire the tech lead behind the most recent UX/UI update. It is not intuitive, just made the experience worse	feature request
Still Buggy. I'd like to make this my main messaging app, but always has something that needs fixed. Cuatom Notification is just here today, gone tomorrow, beck the next, gone again soon. I need Custom Notifications for Clients.	bug report

I WAS super impressed with the sound/ call quality. Twenty-four hours after installing I had to uninstall this app. The sudden increase of ad notifications from sketchy adult site offering hookups and telling me my phone/ chrome was infected.

Within about 15 minutes, bliss, there was quiet. No more constant dinging with notifications.	bug report

The new UI isn't good especially on foldables. Since it's not optimized properly the new bottom bar for the app overlays with the navigation bar of android and so you can't pick an option to go to DM or servers or whatever since it'll activate the navigation bar's buttons. Also specifically for foldables discord app doesn't automatically change its format when folding or unfolding so you'd have to close the app entirely, fold/unfold and reopen the app to make it work.

I don't love the new layout, it's honestly harder for me to use and as someone who struggles with this type of layout it makes it hard for me to want to use the app. I hope that there will be a option to either go back to the old layout or it changes because I don't like it.	feature request
New layout is terrible and drives data rates up like crazy in addition to 10x the loading times BEWARE!!	bug report
I called using this app & left a voice mail.

Honestly never had any problems with discord on my phone till the newis update the whole new layout is horrible, I love using discord bc it had a completely different lay out from all the other messager apps but now it looks just like any other one.

I really like Discord. It's just that the recent update has lowered my opinion on it in general. If there was an option to go back to the old layout (which I do not have in case if it's supposed to be available), then I think that'd help improve the app.	feature request

I've used Discord for years. It's one of the only apps I used. But the new system that they'll be using for usernames is asinine. The already existing system works fine, and nobody wants it to change. And yet the support team is silent. Listen to your users, discord.	feature request
For those who have a business this is a great asset to use. It's FREE! Reliable and can be accessible from various devices! And If you simply like privacy, Download it now! Thanks TextNow and myself later! :-) Just read a couple views and came back to edit, folks are so negative these days. Never had an issue with calling unless the typical just like with all phone services and never an issue with sending a message. The ads are every once in a while. Like after you make a call. No big deal!	feature request

I've been using Signal for years and then you finally enabled group voice and video chats which is great for organizing. But now you want to get rid of SMS messaging which is ridiculous. I use the app for all my messages and there is no practical point to stop SMS messages. You're allowing phone service companies to transmit our msgs will result in less privacy which is antithetical to the reason Signal exists.	feature request

So I chose to get the sim card and pay for phone data. They say you're using a certain amount of gigs when you are not. They run your mobile experience TO THE GROUND. You'll be out of tons of money within days to weeks, when you can simply just pay for a 30 buck phone bill. These people are rip offs. I've spent too much, and hardly even use my phone, and they are still burning my data even if I connect to wifi and use it. It's not worth it. I've spent almost 100 replacing just 2gs in a month!	bug report

I have been using it for a week or so. It's ok so far. I just wish the size of the input box (the box where you type your message) were bigger. As it currently is, you have to scroll up or down within the box to reread it which is very tedious if you normally have longer messages. The size of the box so tiny compared to the size of the whole phone screen. Why not make use of the space and enlarge the box? Also, I don't see any options to adjust text size or font. That would be very helpful.	feature request
Great app, been using it for 1 &1/2 years and has come a long way, I've compiled a list of my favorite ideas for updates to this app from the comments, 1. Dark theme / mode 2. Improved gui / graphics 3. Latency tweaks (in sending & receiving sms & lag in general) 4. Cheap (like 0.99) ad-free 5. Fix the refreshing bug (occasional endless refresh loop)	feature request
Used to love this app but couple days started screwing up. Click to open it and click to message and it mid type it jumps.back to a blank screen. Gonna reinstall and hope that works otherwise find another one. 10/2018 For some reason suddenly calls drop and I when a call comes in it won't let me answer. Gonna be checking other apps. Good product once upon a time.	bug report
This app has gone from streamlined and easy to move through to incredibly clunky and frustrating. It's not a learning curve thing, it's a bad design change thing. AND STOP asking if I want to turn on notifications.	bug report
There were some issues with voice messages before the update in which it wouldn't play but it wasn't frequent so I thought it was just a minor bug. However, since the recent update, almost every voice message is just not working and I experienced a really bad glitch where I couldn't scroll up or down, the screen was just bouncing around each time I tired. I think the update broke discord- please try to get this fixed soon-	bug report

Yeah, I see the point of some of the other reviewers. It IS SLOW, and doesn't seem to always connect. I guess I'll keep using it to offload some of my less important texts, but keep my real text service for anything important. I'm sure they'll continue to make it better over time....	bug report

Since switching away from a native Android application, this app has gotten progressively worse.

Always enjoying this app, i get used to chat with my friends here. Here is the problem, discord in window run smooth and better. Unlike mobile version, it has lot of bugs.

This app is garbage. That one star is because it's free. I can't call or video call my parents without making a regular call first.

With other apps, I can call with this hassle.	bug report
Decent app... Does what it says it does... Its a little hard to get free minutes... But if youre in a bind and dont have the time to watch 30 second videos for 2 minutes of call time minutes are rather cheap and can be bought starting at 2 dollars but this is tezt free not call free so i will give them 3 stars because for text it works perfectly fine they would actually get 5 stars if it wasnt for the annoying pop ups and random ads that come out of nowhere at times.

All of a sudden pictures are not loading. I receive notification & when I open there's a blank square with a reload arrow but it can't even be tapped. Chat icon images are not appearing either. I use this app to manage my baseball team and it is very frustrating when an important image is sent and I have no way of retrieving it.	bug report
I agree with the general public's opinion on the new UI, it does make things a little more awkward. But I do still love discord and it's features. One thing I would love them to add in the near future would be custom notifications for servers/dms. I use that feature on apps like whatsapp, and it would be another useful tool to have in discord as well.	feature request
Overall the app is great, theres just one missing feature that is very frustrating, I have 2 accounts I switch between often and theres no way to save them to quickly switch without logging in and out every time, which is odd because the feature exists on the desktop discord app just not on mobile. Other than that minor issue the app is amazing, a very user friendly interface that makes it easy to host and swap between many different communities and never miss a beat	feature request

This app is alright just for messaging, but when I go into calls with video or just audio the person the other side says they can't hear me, so I switch to LTE and they say it still doesn't work, so once again I switch to wifi and they say it's better. Overall, if your gonna use this app just use it for messaging and if you want a good video calling and audio app then Google duo is perfect.	bug report

You guys need to fix the issue where you sign in with CORRECT INFORMATION and says it is wrong. I signed out of an account, trying to sign into my main account, reset my password as it would not let me in with my previous one, and for the last three days i have not been able to sign in. I am 100% sure i am entering all of my information correctly. Every time i attempt to sign in, it says i have failed the login attempt. Even after reinstalling the app twice. This app is highly broken. Also, messages will frequently fail to be exchanged, and the formatting recent update is much harder to use than the previous version.	bug report

The desktop app is lovely, but the new UI for mobile sucks so bad. I haven't heard a single person say they like it. I'm BEGGING for a social media/messaging app that just stays consistent and doesn't make major changes like this.

With the new updated UI, the mobile app feels a little more mobile-y and definitely looks to be meant for phones. Main issue is that the full execution is poor. The old UI was quick and snappy with navigation, and the new UI is laggy and sluggish. It can take a few seconds for presses to register. Some settings are hidden and difficult to navigate to, like changing stream volume. The app doesn't always stay on the new UI either, it sometimes flips between both old and new on entry.	bug report
Sending pictures has gotten much better!! I do have an issue with the phone not notifying me that someone is calling.

Stop supporting Signal. No more money due to their lack of SMS support. I know mixing plaintext with encrypted text weakens encrypted text, but I could never get some users and family members to switch to Signal. Since I must stay in contact with them only my few groups that have Signal, I will use SMS for most of my communications and use Signal only for the few contacts that have it. Too bad Signal did not elect to have their Signal groups send plaintext to everyone if anyone is plaintext ü§®	feature request

Good experience. Except, sharing limited photos üì∏ options. 7-20-22. Updated: For Signal, the main issue with the SMS feature is the lack of security.

I see what they are trying to do, but they executed it very poorly. The actual app is horrible. Every time I go into the app, guess what comes up first. The ads come up first even before my messages come up. You would also think they would put ads in the texting portion but they did that too. And if you have a slightly slow phone, that that ruins everything. When you send the text, the keyboard is collapsed, revealing a huge ad that gets in your way. That "feature" in the app really makes it hard to send multiple texts at once, since you have to keep clicking the box to get your keyboard up. I really wished they just changed this. This app would be perfectly fine if it wasn't loaded up with ads that make your phone slow. And I would rather buy a plan than get the ad block subscription, cause then I would not be free.	feature request

Still has some issues for mobile. I don't like that I manually have to follow tickets individually in a server.

Recent update.. Dec 6th 2023 really messed up the experience for me, the UI is so laggy and cumbersome to navigate. Randomly it browsing different channels the page would get stuck on the previous channel. You have to force quit the app so it will refresh. Running on a pixel 7. Give us the ability to go back to the old UI	feature request
if i could no stars i would. this app had me purchase mintues even b4 using, then when i had a call the other person couldn't hear me, so they kept having to call back. once we finally connected there was a massive delay in the conversation. i have only had 1 successful call and now its telling the caller his number is restricted. want to uninstall, unfortunately i will lose the money i put on it for minutes..DON'T INSTALL APP, waste of time	bug report

I did everything and know everything I need to know but I still can't login. Besides that, I love it.	bug report
Every update the app just gets worse, what was so wrong with the old format? I would have rated it as 4 stars before, but with every update they change something else that was completely fine and it creates a gazillion bugs.	bug report

Here I thought the new update would've fixed the minor gltiches and bugs when accessing the app through the message notifs but it didn't it actually made the app load a bit slower than before. The new update also feels unnecessary, I mean why isolate the dms? It alwas just fine before sitting at the topper left corner. It feels off the the dms are now at the bottom part seperated from the servers not to mention the active status of each member in the server really feels off as from slide to tap.	feature request

So far, so good....no probs; however, I am concerned about the process after mins run out. As for now, works excellent, clear on calls, quick on texts. Biggest complaint, are adverts. Need to inform the market, it is like streaming~pay to eliminate ads.	feature request
Very happy with this app.	irrelevant information

I'm only reviewing the mobile app here. This app is really annoying. There are so many features missing from discord mobile that half the things you can use normally don't even work at all on a phone, like, you can send gifs on a phone, but you can only favorite them on a computer. If it wasn't for issues like these it would be a perfect 5 star review, but with so many things missing it really is frustrating to use the mobile app or to even attempt to manage a server from only a phone.	feature request
Am trying to cancel subscription and Skype ignore and won't let me!!	bug report
This app is great for fun times with my friends and stuff but I have a few things that I think should be known: ‚Ä¢Whenever I'm on a call with one of my friends and I want to screen share something it immediately kicks me out of the app, can't even stream family guy :[. ‚Ä¢And more of a recommendation then an complaint but..I think a feature to sort DM's and group chats into folders like the servers would be neat, like for projects, archives, and stuff, and would just feel way more organized	feature request

Stop it. Stop changing things for the sake of changing things. Stop making things worse just for the sake of making it newer, and then force everyone to use your slop. Either fire every single "UI designer" you claim to have employed and get an entirely new set, or allow us to never use the garbage they produce. Edit: I don't care about your stupid bloody article. Nobody does. Revert the change.	feature request
Deleted all my pictures, gifs and voice-mailfrom the app when I uninstalled. Otherwise it works great as long as your wifi signal is strong.	bug report

It has its pros and cons.	irrelevant information
Dropping my review from 5 to 2 stars. Ever since the framework update, this platform has been borderline unusable on Android. Each "bugfix" they release simply adds more bugs and fails to patch the glaring issues with the app (e.g. gifs slowing the platform to a screeching halt??). I would be more understanding if there was an active attempt at developing fixes for this broken platform, but some of these bugs have been around for years. Please focus on fixing before you add more things.	bug report

Awesome but I had to use text now to use door dash and order food get a verification code etc	feature request
Good god, this is one of the least intuitive apps I've seen in my life! It won't let me edit or copy the number I just called. It won't offer to just redial the number I just called. It won't automatically set the country code I just used as default for the next call, instead reverting to no code at all. Not to mention that the interface is not intuitive at all when you're trying to find a lot of things, like checking your balance or where to top up your credits. I'll look for another app!	bug report
No so good, it takes a lot of time to join a call.	bug report
This app has completely stopped working for me it refuses to let me log in even after I have changed my password. I keep getting an error message no matter what I do.	bug report
Just wished that I could just verify simply just with my email... Getting dumb errors saying: Someone else is using this phone number, try detaching your phone number from the other account.

Recently it hasn't been working well at all. It never loads chats properly and sometimes I have to reinstall.

Text now is excellent service. My only complaint is that it auto synced to Google pay which won't verify my debit card so I can't pay for premium service.

I've used this app for over 2 years, and I'm really disappointed from the new updates. After the new nitro update came out discord started to function less.

Discord is a lot more slow now, and even the new voice chat templates aren't it. PLEASE listen to your users	feature request

For the most part the app is fine, but two issues bother me more than the others: 1. The keyboard will randomly go down and not reopen for roughly 30 secs-1 min. It doesn't happen often, only when I type fast or have a laggy connection. It's been around for about 3 months for me if not longer now. 2. Reactions don't appear for me anymore. No matter what I do, I physically cannot see reactions on messages unless they are on an image or video, nor can I remove a reaction of any kind.	bug report

I've been using Discord both on desktop and mobile for over half a decade, and always appreciated that I could swap between the two and get similar appearance and functionality while also having a consistent experience interacting with its features over that span of time.

New layout is way less user friendly and the video-calling background is not appealing in any way, shape, or form. Why can't I change the color? We want actual dark mode please. The buttons are also literally on top of eachother, so good luck if you don't have baby fingers. Discord thinks you want voice calling on phone by default. Occasionally, your screen go black for no reason. Optimization is extremely bad.	bug report
It doesn't even let me sign in! Letter doesn't show up when you type!	bug report
its not optimized, at least. this apps feels like is draining battery and resources like crazy. If you try to switch apps between a call, you'll probably notice what I'm saying. hope for a lighter version...	bug report

Love discord, using it for a while now but the new update is buddy ash.

I started using Discord because it was different from other messaging apps, in an innovating and fresh way. With the latest update and the new theme Discord has lost all of its uniqueness, everything takes longer to do, DMs are annoying to get to and oh the lag, it's unbearable how sluggish it is compared to the snappy quick older versions.	feature request

Took away my ohone number without warning, displays it at the top of a list of free numbers, then claims it was taken the moment in between loading the list and claiming the number. Refreshing the list by closing and reopening the app, restarting my phone, etc, still shows my old number as free yet makes the same claim it "just got snatched up by another user." Clearly a scam. This used to be a decent texting app even though it was full of ads. Avoid or don't expect to actually use your number.	bug report

Been using Discord for 8 years, one of the greatest apps I have ever used.

Half the time the phone calls don't go through or it calls the person AGAIN while I'm trying to talk on the phone with them. There hasn't been a single call that the other person didn't complain they couldn't hear me or it sounded like I was "talking through a tunnel". I wish I could change the timestamps because it gets really confusing, and not that is the biggest deal but it'd be nice to be able to delete more than one conversation at once or personalize. I do like the fact that I can earn my minutes.	feature request
Signal being destroyed from the inside. So many years of good faith & spreading security practices will also now be destroyed as people move to something else. Gaslighting excuses do not fly. In IT we have SMS for all sorts of systems, alerts & processes. Have a package being delivered? A doctor's appointment? Government and service provider alerts? Make no mistake, long running message delivery delays is the reason to remove SMS support AND force app update, no other logical explanation. Shame.	bug report

Changing my rate to 3 stars, after updating the app, it forced me to change my username (not the display name i always use), the numbers (i.e #5533) were way better and made the app unique, now you are making users fight for a username they wanted but they cant because someone else took it, i will change my rating if the numbers make a return next to our names again like it did a month ago	bug report
Who don't get me started with let's just say that because of this app nothing can ever happen to me	irrelevant information
The UI update has ruined years of muscle memory for me. Along with the awful UI update, AMOLED was never fixed to be true AMOLED, and the issues with scammers and generally awful people on their app has not ceased. Whatever Discord is trying to be, they're not trying very hard to change the way their app and their community functions and supports itself. Discord hasn't listened to any voices on any platform telling them that the choices they are making for the app are making the app worse.	feature request
Whoever made the decision to mess up the UI should be fired. Whoever made the decision to force the update through even when auto update is off needs to be jailed.	feature request
The only problem I have with it is, my phone has to be unlocked in order for my messages top come through.	bug report
New app interface is unfriendly, cant search for messages anymore and the app runs really poorly now. Previously free things now cost money and in general they are making mobile discord a lot harder to navigate. Old version was so much better and cleaner i dont know why they changed it	bug report
its okay not the best but its useable	irrelevant information
Good messaging app but would be better if there was a bubble notification on the icon to know of new messages	feature request
Good on one device but does not give the option to link to another device only transfer or restore account.	bug report
Tell me, who asked for the new UI? I know us users didn't. At least give us the option to go back ffs, and why crop the images sent? It was just fine before! Edit: You also have to reopen the app after sending a picture to see the new messages??? Just bring the old UI back	feature request

It's a fun app to talk to your friends but sometimes I got these invites that are Kinda not good for kids like girls showing They're private part and boys showing they're private part too so pls discord if you can fix this fix it	bug report
Is not intuitive or practical.. colors are distracting.. needs a lot more structure and a better design	feature request
I'm using it for a couple of month.And it crashes a lot of time,which is really disappointing.I always heard this app as a great application for commercial community as well as personal use.But using it personally,I don't feel pleased.Needs to improve a lot.	bug report

The stark white theme is still an eyesore. There are a lot of updates but no description as to what is being improved upon. Is it really difficult to make the background darker? Even sepia would be better	feature request
I keep getting "pulled" to these cyber crime discord servers and then later I would just get an account warning and I'm genuinely confused on how I'm joining these servers without even being on for it.	bug report
Why is it essential to change my number EVERY week now I paid for features a few months and when I cancelled my plan you guys literally have FORCED me to keep paying y'all to have my same number I've had to change numbers because of your system 5 different times now it's so inconvenient to be told my number will be given away even though I text,call and use my number EVERYDAY. This app used to be really helpful and easy to use now it's just a useless cash grab to even USE the app	bug report
Crashin since the latest update :/ :sadface:	bug report
I enjoy using this app... I recommend it to others. I wish I could go back and see the phone numbers I put in as administrator or call directly when needed. Thanks for the service you provide.	feature request
removal of sms support is unbelievable to me. signal drops from my favorite app to 1 star and will probably be forgotten on my phone until I get a new one and forgets to install it again...	feature request
It's not letting me find my sports group, and every time I put in a school email, it just says there is nothing there. I need help.	bug report

I really enjoy discord. Its good for chatting and playing games with friends on vc. But I tried to log into my account after accidently deleting the app, but it won't let me log in to the account.	bug report
Dropped from four to two stars because a recent update makes it really annoying and intrusive the way it pops up with messages. It's not overly friendly in terms of maximising the screen after and there are no obvious settings to remove the feature.	feature request

Love discord never rated it but it was 5/5 now it's a 3/5 calls on the phone app disconnecting after 3 minutes is an issue when discord is temperamental and will drop calls randomly and there's a compiling error now so it'll random crash completely and it's been like that for months!	bug report
Dont have need to use it very often, but makes it simple and easy when I do	irrelevant information
Ultra rare error. What i know from that (ultra rare error) is that the discord and many other Web sites were banned from my location and some more Arabic cites and places, please look for that error and fix it, I have work on my discord account and I been using discord since it's came to our Devices and I have important flies and memories I don't want to loss. (I'm asking you nicely to fix the problem)	bug report
Great app, the worst thing about it is trying to get other people to use it	feature request
layout takes up the screen. (Put the call back in notification). Android	feature request
They're dropping sms support which means it won't be useful for me anymore. Not everyone I know uses signal and I'm not going to be switching between apps based on what messaging app everyone else uses. I wish everyone used signal but it's never going to happen, especially if you remove features that make it useful. This is a step backwards.	feature request
Don't use this app its stupid it won't let you get verification codes, it has way too many ads, and the quality is horrible	bug report
Ever since the latest update unable to make or receive calls. It showing I have no signal and no it's not my internet connection.	bug report
When this app actually works, it's great for making and receiving calls. But when it doesn't work, it will frustrated you to no end. On TWO completely different phones, I have had a glitch (recurring) where I cannot answer phone calls on this app. The phone will ring, I'll hit answer, it will act as if it has answered, but continue ringing, not allowing me to speak to whoever is on the other end. On my second phone, I absolutely cannot make calls with this app. the: ZTE Axon 7, LG V35 ThinQ	bug report
Since there doesn't seem to be any way to report a bug to the developers, I'm going to leave a bad review here in hopes they see it because this bug is actually bad enough to affect usability to a frustrating level. I am on a free plan and so I understand that ad support is necessary. My problem is that the full page ads don't seem to provide any way to close them. I've resorted to having to press the "square" button on my phone and forcibly close the TextNow app every time I get a full-screen ad. Please give me an "X" to get rid of the ad after a few seconds. Thank you!	feature request

Sad now that I have no service to dial out or receive calls but texts go through. Was told I may have to delete for good	bug report
Invitation Not working	bug report
For a free phone app, its ok. A lot of the problems with this app is that calls get dropped or you don't see or hear a call coming in and it goes straight to voicemail. Also you get a lot of text with as and if you don't want the ads of course you have to pay for them. And it's not compatible for all phones which if it was compatible with all phones oh, I would give it five stars but it always claims that it is when it's not.	bug report
It keeps glitching and won't let me keep the app open no matter how many times I delete and reinstall. Just shuts down involuntarily. Please fix this	bug report
Works exactly as expected	irrelevant information
I used to love and appreciate this app for both business and common use. However it's now threatening to cut off ALL communication to all contacts that don't use their app. This exclusion is bullying and is unacceptable. Signal's decision is forcing myself and many others to leave and find a new platform.	feature request
Video call are not working anymore and the status keeps on changing even if i put myself in invisible after few minutes it will put me back to online.	bug report
The main issue I have with this app is it's hit or miss getting texts. Usually miss. Especially verification texts from a bank or PayPal which is definitely a problem. Yet I will get random wrong texts from people no problem which is insane. Doesn't matter if I'm on WiFi or using data this happens. Also call quality can be dreadful depending where you're standing. I usually have to move around to get a good single and people assume I'm on speaker.	bug report

For the first two weeks this app was fine but now it's starting to have problems with the connection like the phone keeps breaking up and the worst part of all is you're able to watch videos to get more free minutes but now it no longer allows me to watch videos.

Restore Discord, The new update is garbageü§¨üëäüëäüëäüëä	feature request
The screen just greyed out and the wheel kept spinning. I uninstalled and reinstalled with no change of results.	bug report
Flooded with unnecessary changes	feature request
I love Discord. I use it almost exclusively to communicate with my friends. But this new mobile update is the worst. It is incredibly glitchy. I have messages that got deleted the moment I hit send. My DMs keep jumping up to older messages no matter how many times I mark them as read. And the new UI is a pain. I still haven't figured out how to view the members in a server and who's online. I'll be uninstalling until it's fixed.	bug report
Not a fan of the new update. The fact I have to click through multiple screens to get to the server I'm typically on when I used to be able to swipe and see everything on mobile is really frustrating. It also makes it harder for me to keep track of notifications because I have to go to the new homepage(?) to see the list at the bottom and hope I see the blue dot. Maybe this is good for people on a ton of servers, but it's not working for me. Looking for any way to undo the update.	feature request
Honestly this app sucks I'm just using it to get 100 robux	irrelevant information
I like it, clear calls, only draw back is that it doesn't allow for long conversations, 30mins per call, so after ever 30mins it just cuts off.	bug report
Needs more notification preferences. I don't want notifications when someone changes their name or leaves the group.	feature request
They changed the layout from easy, fast and convenient to navigate into something inconvenient and horribly ugly. Please revert or we will find alternatives to Discord.	feature request
Good way to keep a group informed, still a little clunky in its formatting	irrelevant information
Best there is for encrypted private messaging	irrelevant information

My notifications are turned on. Why don't I get notifications on my Android phone when a friend messages me? I've been having to log in on my computer to check messages unless I start a conversation on my phone. The messages I send and receive on my computer never show up on my phone. Please fix this.	bug report

I dropped rate to 2 cuz that's baddest style I have ever seen I wish the old style back	feature request
It ok. The quality of the calls vary from good to very spotty. The texting is ok. But sometimes the pop ups disrupt the texts. But again it's ok for a free app. Can't really complain	bug report
The interface is extremely hard to use. I'm a long time user and it used to be easy. When a call comes it is difficult to answer . There seems to be a delay in notification and 50% of calls are dropped unless I can see the call coming in. The integration with contacts doesnt work and there is no help. Basically it does less than it used to .	bug report

All the negative reviews are true. I myself have been using Skype for almost two years now but I haven't seen any improvements at all. Clicking on things ang loading conversations takes 5 seconds or more, and I'm not even exaggerating. If anything, all they did was change the app's look a little for aesthetics. Talk about priorities and competent management.	bug report
This app is the worst talking app ever! I cant even upload it to my phone!! Ive been sitting here for 2 or 3 minits waiting. No one upload this app!	bug report

With dropping SMS, I no longer have a one stop shop for both my secure and insecure messages, and that is a massive pain, and problem. I can't make everyone I know use Signal so if I wanted to keep using it, I'd have to juggle another messaging app, which I am not up for. Ugh.	feature request

Way to many ads, and then there's more ads, can't forget the most loved auto playing ads. Voice calls are HORRIBLE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. If you can look past the ads and HORRIBLE VOICE it's ok for texting but not for a confirmation texts. I would rate higher if it could do confirmation text. It's ok if you don't have phone service. Disappointing	bug report
Made me constantly change my phone number	bug report
fun but can't solve the Rolex submission	irrelevant information
The newest update really stinks. From a consumer point of view, needing to click multiple times to leave a message, then to click over onto "servers" and then have to click back twice AGAIN to be able to see the list of servers I am in, when in the previous version it was two clicks maximum, is ridiculous. The new layouts are frustrating. "Midnight" is just #ffffff text on #000000 backgrounds, which strains the eyes. The "dark" theme, instead of a simple grey, is a saturated dark blue! What!	feature request
I don't know what's wrong with Discord phone number verification these days. When I send in my real phone number then I get the code when I past the real code of the phone number it's says it's an invalid code. Discord is horrible and lazy to fix it's bugs	bug report

It's a good app for the most part. I've noticed like one flaw. My biggest problem with this app is that I've been trying to send verification codes to my number, it will send me an error message. The message states that I need to upgrade my account and pay money to be able to see the verification code. It's a really good app that is for the most part free unless you want to buy a sim card off if the app or if you want to upgrade the app to see confirmation codes that come via text message.	bug report

I feel tgatvwe should be able to delete people from contacts. I had a whole bunch of people added to my contacts that I didn't know but also that I don't want. There should be a mass delete button for us to remove people that we do not want while we keep the ones that we do.	feature request

Absolutely God awful, notifications work about 20% of the time, if you're lucky. Messages sometimes don't send, and there's no encryption whatsoever, the only reason I even have this is because of a group chat for work, if I could convince them to use something else, I would.	bug report

Went from being my favorite to most of my friends who used it uninstalling it after they stopped sending to SMS.

Until I've used this did not happen. First off it just doesn't work. It won't make calls unless you try repeatedly. When you're finally connected it will soon drop. If somehow you connect you won't hear each other, and then it will drop. Beyond that it has disconnected my internet. I've tested 3 different wifi and each time it will read connected with no internet until i turn it off and back on. This is my emergency backup and it needs to work.

Extraordinarily clumsy software. Particularly when linking to a pc. Won't load history.

No one else in the chat has this issue, and I still get their notifications for those channels, but I can't respond and the channel disappears again when I exit out.

Better than the pc and website version. Since you can get the free trial discord nitro using the e-wallet you have in your country while not having paypal or credit card thing. Only one downside is that you can't even play the MP3s properly. Instead you just downloaded them.	feature request

A decent app to use. A lot of ads but I understand to keep it free. I don't like using the calling option just because reception is usually bad as well as a lot of dropped calls. I use it basically everyday except for weekends just for work so I'm not having to give out my personal phone number. I used this app a long time ago when all I had was an ipod as a teenager so it hasn't changed too much just the increase in ads and somehow reception has gotten worse.	irrelevant information
This app is awesome and would give it a 5 star rating if I didn't have 1 problem with the number pad. The number pad does not work when in call and have to use number pad for ex. number. When I try to use this it continues to make a buzz noise and won't stop?	feature request

The new ui is so bad and some added features (like the new "add friends from contacts" being turned on by default, endangering people in abusive households) are downright predatory.

So I made a second account and now that account isn't even being brought up by my email or my current phone number and I had built up quite a big community on that account and I don't want to lose I wish they had an alternate sign in or way to find your account like Facebook. it'd be easier	bug report
It used to be awesome. Now it's just closed source daily updates, everything is slow, and messages don't come in on time. Since the company has started using closed source software to "combat spam" as they put it, the program has gotten slower to load and slower to use. By a lot. Links rarely load, messages fail daily, and everything takes 2 times longer. As if they're logging everything now. Sadly, you have no other options for secure messaging anymore. Welcome to the post privacy age.	bug report
New to the GroupMe app but seems like a really good way to stay in touch as an organization or group. Easy to plan events, stay connected and chat with multiple recipients	irrelevant information
I truly appreciated the features and security of Signal; however the decision to end support for SMS is exceedingly unfortunate for those users who must communicate with both Signal and SMS users. I, regretably, will no longer use or recommend Signal, unless SMS support is reinstated.	feature request

So, not a five-star review. Why? After all three years in so unable to use Signal from more than one Android device. There's no way to "link" a tablet to my mobile phone, say. I can use do so on Windows or Mac but not on Android. Other than this app is great.	feature request

I like a lot of the features that come with it, but I have a few complaints 1. On mobile, I can't scroll down to see the servers I'm in, so sometimes I can't see the icon. 2. The new usernames are really annoying, I don't like the way I can't do as much with it 3. There's this weird bug thing that still marks a channel as unread even though I opened it and it's annoying	bug report
This recent update made the app more confusing to navigate and makes it run slower. The old layout of the app worked fine and was intuitive for mobile with no room for confusion. You are better off not getting the mobile version until they roll back this change.	bug report
The only consistent thing about this app is the constant failure to install the next available update.	bug report
The new layout is awful. It takes far to many interactions with my screen to swtich between my messages and servers now. It also took me forever to find out how to see who is in my server and online. Not to mention that it takes 4 interactions to go from dms to a new server instead of just 2. This is an awful usability update and i dont care that it looks slightly better. I told all my friends to disable auto update so they wouldnt have to suffer through this. It was far better before.	feature request

Worst app yet. I literally just got it a few minutes ago and every time I try to send a stext it says my number has been deactivated because of not using it.

The app wouldnt be so bad if the ads werent so obsessive. The ads lag the experience. App does remember texts via email login. Can keep same phone number for a while. Dark mode would be nice.

It takes more taps/swipes/etc to navigate the app than it used to and there is now less on screen at once while simultaneously feeling busier due to all channels now having icons.

To be honest, the update isn't my favorite. I prefer to be able to swipe left to see the current people online in the server rather than it being the new reply feature. There was nothing on how to find the online members, and I had to find it myself. Also, another thing that upsets me is that the app is very slow to open ever since the update. I click on the app, and it sends me to a blank screen, and then it takes a good 10 secs to load anything. I like fancy but simplicity on the phone is best	feature request

Opportunistic encryption has always had the highest chance of succeeding in populations that don't actively seek it out (see https and imessage). Signal's dual use of both encrypted messages and sms function did this. Unfortunately, the small number of contacts I have that also used signal isn't worth keeping the app installed on my phone. Deleted my account, and will be looking for a different solution that provides opportunistic encryption for SMS.	feature request

I love this app but there's bugs that need fixing. I am using it currently on a Poco X3 Pro and there's visibility issues such as text appearing with white background to the point where it's hard to read and the color wheel for the profile banner is impossible to use as for example when you put it on white it shows black on the banner itself. Please fix these, people who can't pay for Nitro barely get customization as it is, this just makes it even worse. Just to note, I am using dark mode.	bug report

I had Discord for 5 years now. It was a great app back in the days. But now, I absolutely HATE the layout. It's nothing compared to what I'm used to. Discord doesn't even listen to popular opinion, so there's no point in writing this. The option to view the members list has completed been altered. Instead of the original swiping left to view members list (which is now an automatic reply to messages), you have to tap on the channel name. It's so ridiculous for us OGs.	feature request
The day has finally come, no SMS support. This is now a 0/5 review. Goodbye Signal. I have no intention of keeping this app when SMS capability is removed. At that point it joins the ranks of telegrams and whatsapps and is no longer differentiated by its SMS capability. Sad to see a great product fall.	feature request

Skype is a reliable and user-friendly app that provides seamless video and voice calls, messaging, and file sharing, making it an essential tool for staying connected with friends, family, and colleagues. Highly recommended.	irrelevant information
Latest update ruins the user friendliness entirely. Messages are on a seperate tab, you can no longer see who is in a server pnly who has access to a given chat. If I want to see which friends are online I have to go under my own profile, scroll to the bottom and click friends where all it will show all of them sorted alphabetically, online or not. In short: useless menus have been added to hide things in order to save me 3 seconds of load-time.	feature request

For at least a month now, no messages have successfully been sent or received between two devices that were previously working okay with Signal . We even removed and re-installed the app on both devices and it still doesn't work.

In many discord servers I find I can't seen the text on the titles for each section and often if I can I can't see the content as though nobody ever posted in it.

It was really great before; the old UI was a great translation from the PC version to this mobile app but they did a complete redesign recently that doesn't go well with a lot in my opinion.

They're mocking us at this point. It is increasingly clear that they do not care one bit about their users or our feedback, only their investors. Review after review is getting a terrible canned reply from the "dev" and it's so tone deaf it's insulting.

Worst UI update yet. Slow, buggy, and infuriating to navigate. Canceled my Nitro. If it ain't broke, don't fix it Discord ffs	bug report
Signal became okay once I understood how to use it without using my mobile carrier's texting number. It would be nice if that were more clear. Also, it "expires" FAR too often for my taste, and each time that happens, I have to relink my other devices; that is an infuriating annoyance. If I can't use ONE stable version for 12 months, it's usefulness, to me, is severely diminished. The updates have become quite tiring.	feature request
its good over all but the some issues I find really annoying are when I'm in a call with someone and I turn my Bluetooth off and it switches to phone instead of speaker which turns my screen black if I have something over my camera. the other issue is that when I switch channels or servers the previous text stays up and I have to re open discord to get where I want to go	bug report
One of the reasons I like discord is because it did things unique to other social media and didn't try to be a clone, it knew it's niche and it did it well, but over the last year it seems hell bent on joining the race to the bottom by being a twitter & whatsapp clone. I wouldn't bother anymore Update: Discord's response doesn't help anything as per usual, maybe if 17% of your staff were still there I'd have gotten a decent response.	feature request

Unless you guys find a way to fix this im sorry about the review.	bug report
App has started spawning full screen ads plus the ads in list of messages. It often fails to notify despite setting for notifications turned on. Phone calling is horrible. Cuts out, pops, echo. Very cheap. Messages will jump (move) up and down to force user to click an ad. Sending photos or video is hit and miss.	bug report
Good points:  Can call and talk to whoever you need to for free, as long as they have their Skype account and wifi too.  Group calls And for a miniscule group of users which I've never seen anyone in my Skype contacts use: the story like function-esque from snapchat.   Bad points:  Microphone choice might go from speaker to headset upon notification, media, or randomly. The layover thing in a call is extremely annoying. Please do fix.  The Skype suggestion/complaints things really could use some help, I've read replies from Google app ratings/review to contact them within the app to complaint or suggest. Done that, no reply, nor notification. So uh yeah, here's a review you guys honestly deserve.	bug report

The te ting port in is great, but I drop a lot of phone calls. I use this number as a business line for work and it sucks that I drop as many calls as I do.	bug report
I would've gave it a five star but there should be a minor fixes. for example; one time i was calling my friend but she said if i were mute since she couldn't hear me i find it odd since i was talking and told them. I couldn't find whats the problem whatsoever. Second; Verification email. I do have an email and i keep pressing the button to verify my email but when i checked it i couldn't find anything. In my inbox and spam. Well it might be me since i don't often use my email but i checked.	bug report
When I tired to open Signal, asked my phone, but it did not give me verification code. So I tried many time but it is not OK. Why? I think it should be easy to use it if my phone number is correct. Or else should ask my email as well if doubted.And it is confused to confirm if it is human or not. Picture given is not that clear and not mentioned how many do we need to choose.

Uninstalling for ONE reason: Does NOT offer unlimited calls, texts, or MMS. It's 2023! What second phone number app doesn't offer you unlimited, especially for $8.99 a month/$95 annually? I believe the plan offered less than 1000 minutes, and that was for a SMALL BUSINESS?? I'm honestly shopped right now. Other than that, I loved the phone number selection process... That was the best thing about the app.	feature request
Haven't used in years But when I go to sleep a Latino guy hacked my phone and use it against my Will when I am sleeping	bug report

When I receive an incoming call, it doesn't save it in inbox after I hang up. Be nice if it showed calls that dialed me.	feature request
Not a fan of the new mobile UI. Having to open the search to look at the member list of a channel instead of swipe has been frustrating. Don't like the new bottom navigation menu. Much rather use the desktop version when I can.	feature request
It sucks won't work right won't let me text or call so I uninstalled it it glitches out when I call so until you fix it I don't want it	bug report
It is a great way to speak but it is very glitchy	bug report
I love this but my friend is saying bad word with this app please remove it it's not good if somebody else say it it might be a disaster everyone will say bad word and discord you are the one in trouble so I'm trying to just say remove the bad word feature please I don't like it	feature request
Anytime a "free" app has intrusive advertisements that are able to completely cutoff my usage of said app's possible features and abilities to the point i have to close out the advertisement before I am able, or better yet, before it is even possible to continue to use the application,to any degree, as it is intended or otherwise. I have to wonder, have I got the application because I enjoy my ability to close out of intrusive pop-ups? Not likely. ZERO STARS.	bug report
I downloaded text now thus past Nov temporarily until I could get a new phone. I downloaded the free version. Nov 30, Dec 11, 18, 26 7.67 has been coming out of my bank account. Why? I need reimbursement immediately!!!!	bug report

I hate the new UI. Especially that I can't swipe left to see a simplified list of the server members. Or that the ability to narrow your search to a specific channel has been removed. Like, I can't search "in: #general from: username" anymore. And I hate that the app settings location has been changed to a little gear icon at the top of my profile. Edit: Thanks for the reply, but these are not bugs that can be fixed by reinstalling the app. These are changes you made to Discord's UI. Do better.	feature request
It stells you Gmail So don't even try It	bug report
Update: A horrible new mobile update prevents from users being able to check the members inside of a server. It's also the classic nitro, useless nitro you're not able to have a custom profile anymore. You can not create servers as quickly as back then. Please return to the original layout.	feature request

I'm editing this review. Recently the app started glitching so much I just can't stay without saying anything. In android, when I send a pic, the progression mark on top right corner doesn't disappear even after being sent. And the pics often get cut in half in the screen. You can't see the whole pic without opening it. It was better when you could queue a photo and send a message beneath it. But now, when you do that, if the messege manages to reach before the pic, the pic is sent later.	bug report
Having trouble using the search bar. It keeps saying We dropped the magnifying glass. Try searching again. Why does this keep happening? It's rather annoying.	bug report
Won't let me post pics. Everytime I try I get a meme screen and when I try to post a pic it posts a black box!! Please fix this!! Others can post in my groups why can't I?? I have an LG K92 5G phone	bug report

Only been using signal for a week but so far so good!	irrelevant information
usually great but lately... like for example I just now received notification of a call that came in at 759	bug report
The reason why I gave it to a 2 stars is the connection problem. I have good Wi-Fi but it won't let me chat because the connect thing at top. I actually waited like 2 hour and it's won't work. I tried unstall then installed AND airplane mode in and out. Still I'm giving this 2 star, I'm gonna update yall!	bug report
I'm new to the App, but it seems to be pretty good.	irrelevant information
Very good site no issues	irrelevant information
After a text a pop up comes out. Before the ads were at the bottom which didnt bug so much but now theyre annoying.  still works fine though	bug report
Perfect for free calls and text over WiFi. The Only flaw is calls must be in a strong signal range or they won't go through, sound broken up, or get dropped. EDIT: YOU SERIOUSLY NEED TO STOP THESE FULL PAGE ADS AFTER A CALL THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS	bug report
Freezes within a few seconds of starting up. Useless.	bug report
The new overall ui update is inaccessible, clunky and annoying to navigate. The inability to go back to the old format is poorly thought out aswell for those who cannot use the new format. Dms have a separate tab and trying to check whos online replies to messages. Some things are better off staying manual. I hope that soon the ability to switch back will be added, or atleast removing the swipe to reply and moving dms back above servers.	feature request

Sorry for the 4 stars, also I know this is a rate thing but I wanted to ask if you could do something, like I don't know how to say it but, instead of only being able to send 5, maybe make it where we can send more? Maybe 20 or 10, I take a lot of screenshots when I play with my brother on this game called Roblox, I need to delete them but I wanna send them to my mom before I do that, so yeah...	feature request
Great app I talk to my friends on it all the time but for some reason I cannot send images/videos ANYWHERE, this hasnt been a problem at all ever and now it just constantly fails at letting me send anything, ive deleted and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone and yet it wont work and Im really annoyed because I use my phone to send most images on discord	bug report

Cant enable the sim card they sent!! I was using this service for a while and they wanted 99 cents for a new sim card. I can only use this phone now on wifi...	bug report
App is very sensitive and if you change any settings on your phone, not the app, you risk loosing everything in the app itself. Make sure you back up your messages weekly if not daily to your phone or another trusted site, not this app. I lost text messages from loved ones that have since past. Messages I've kept in the app, gone forever. Tried backing up app prior to loosing messages and the app saved it somewhere, I don't know where it went.	bug report
One of the....	bug report
Yall are destroying the app with these updates nore and more now barely anything will load.	bug report
While using the app sometime it shows verify your email id	bug report
Three stars is all you get until the developers sit up and take notice that deleting SMS capability from the app was a bad mistake. Otherwise, the app is a great app, and when the developers fix the SMS issue (when they come to their senses and include it once again in the app), you will receive a five-star rating. Not really understanding what they are trying to do here, possibly other than turn 100 million users into half that. Deleting SMS capability has ticked off a lot of users.	bug report

The mobile update feels extremely poorly designed and reminds me of a qoute, "if it isn't broken don't fix it." Meaning if you fix a problem that doesn't exist you can make things worse. I recommend only using discord on a pc and not mobile app. 1 star only because of this terrible mobile ui update. Please allow us to use the old layout again.	feature request
I remember the thingamajig being light blue instead of purple... xD	irrelevant information

I called for your promised support and work. Nothing was done. My account is the way I was living and need it still. Lost my job, and connection back in my daughter's life. Lost my mom, left without pictures and text because of this. Lost my emailing accounts. This is the worst customer service and employees. Very much unsatisfied. Needed new sim card and was refused. Felt discriminated and no remorse or efforts	bug report
Never works even though i pay for nitro please fix.	bug report
It's been a great app, but in the last week or two, it has stopped notifying me of new messages, so I miss the messages for sometimes multiple days until I reopen the app. If this got fixed, I would up the rating.	bug report
Crashed every single time I wanted to do something other then send a message, until they fix this burning trashpile of an app just use the browser or PC versions	bug report

Good app but could be better SERIOUSLY! I expected better from Pinger folks since they have been in the VOIP business for years. Problem 1: It would ring but disconnect before the call. You have to reset app. The wifi to data transition for call is pretty terrible compared to Hangout. I am getting sign in to Samsng network messages with your SIM everyday Problem 2: You are done with call but can't hang up. You have to clear cache at minimum so it actually ends the call.	bug report
New update is garbage, slow, and cumbersome. Change it back.	bug report

The new update is not mobile user friendly. I can no longer easy swipe to where I need to go. The new UI is so buggy, it makes using the app frustrating and useless. Messages won't send, servers are messed up. Having to click to get anywhere is frustrating, when before you just had to swipe to get somewhere. While it's just as easy, it is not mobile user friendly. Especially when before all you had to was swipe to get anywhere. It was the best thing about the app. Please revert the app.	feature request

I think the fact that you couldn't even include an option to switch back to the old UI (like you did with the first time you changed it) is really scummy, and not something many would expect from a dominator in the messaging sector.

Signal developers really need to look at ways improving this aspect. It should be priority!!! I can't have the phone on charger all day to use the video call feature that's insane.

I can't believe how bad they've made the app in the last 3 months. Every update they make the UI clunkier and slower. Useful swiping gestures are gone, you can reply 2 seconds faster, but if you want to check either sidebar, you're not doing it 1 handed anymore. And that's the main issue here actually, they've RUINED one handed usability. Horrible.	feature request

The new layout sucks. Anyone who has been using Discord for a hefty amount of time would not adjust to the new controls and layout as quickly, if not, at all. This was unnecessary, and at the very least, allow us the option to disable it. As a long-time discord user, I am greatly displeased about this myself. Please take your consumers' input into consideration.	feature request

It slowly gets better, and I like the administrative options and customization. Lots of little things that could get worked out. Highlighted messages are hard to see in midnight mode. Some times events say 3 are interested, but only two are. Crashes are common. Leaving the app for a moment will have you leave a call while still displaying you in the call as though it never disconnected you. (Update: started freezing again. I wish I never edited my review to be so positive [above].)	bug report
Absolutely horrendous. Mic disconnects when it wants to, I can't get through a single phone call or video chat without something going wrong. Not to mention it has so many bugs! Sometimes new messages simply don't show up on the screen even though I get notifications that I got new messages.	bug report

Used to love it. Then it randomly stopped notifying me of messages. All notifications are on both in the app and on my phone.	bug report

I love discord. I use discord every day. Discord is an essential for me to keep in touch with friends. But oh my god please for the love of everything FIX the Android version. It's such a mess. Pretty much every time I launch, I have to exit and re-enter to fix some stupid issue such as showing only half the emotes on the screen with the rest cut off, or showing me the exact same chat from a server even if I change to different servers, channels, or enter dms. There is a whole myriad of issues!	bug report

When it works, it's fine. But that's not often. If you swap to another app for a minute or two, then go back, you'll be greeted with connection issues.

Come on, Discord. What is this update? The bottom panel is so convoluted with buttons, the idea of swiping up a panel full of buttons from video, voice, chat, etc, only for it to open the CHAT is such poor UX. Make each button swipeable: swiping up on the video opens the video settings and so on. Did you even user test this? Please use your own app, ask your staff. Edit: UX is getting there with the new update. At least when you swipe up it opens the voice channel settings. Just very buggy.	feature request

I have to give this the poor rating now since they dropped SMS. Well it's nice to encourage other users switch, don't put the burden on us to make everybody else switch. A lot of the messages coming in are basically informational SMS messages of renewals, Banks or credit alerts, and don't contain personal data. They are not going to change to signal. Signal, you go after them to switch don't put the burden on us. You could easily label to alert messages that are SMS or unsecured messages better.	feature request

This app will not do anything for me thank you	irrelevant information
I'd give this app 5 stars except that it doesn't seem to remember/care that I told it I don't want picture-in-picture enabled. About once a week or so, it pops up a message asking me if I want to enable it. I've already said "no" to this feature so it should stop asking me again. If I want to use it, I'll go into the app settings and enable it myself. If they can fix this annoying user interaction issue I'll change my rating.	bug report

Delayed messages by days	bug report
I am only using this app until I can get a real phone number. It's infuriating to use constantly delaying and if someone tries to call me and I hit "answer" like a thousand times before it actually answers. And the call itself is garbage. Half the time they can't hear me and the other half it drops the call. And I realize that these types if apps need to have ads but these ads take up HALF THE SCREEN. I can't even see my texts because the giant ad covers it. I despise this app.	bug report
UI is extremely cumbersome and overall less functional. Revert the swipe changes at least...	feature request
Before it was not too bad, now this app is terrible, and if you contact support they asked to uninstall and reinstall but even then won't work I called just now 3 different numbers and they can't hear me or it disconnected right after they pick up. So I had to use a landline to call I'm giving two star cause I. Can text but not too sure if they are receiving my text, and now I'm paying weekly cause unfortunately this number is the one I had list for verification and they send me codes to it so.	bug report

Discord has been a great communication platform, and no problems happened to me, no bugs or anything. If you'd like to chat with anyone, this is the best app you could use. And voice chat or share your screen. I suggest you use this app. This is so incredible! I love this app, and I've been using it for years. 100% recommended.	irrelevant information

From 5 to 1 stars. I was able to get some of my circle into signal since they could just replace sms. They never really rev knew it was a different app. Now signal had just made it's self redundant to other apps that we already use. I see more users dropping it, I will likely as well. Today was the first time I opened signal in over a month and it was just to clear a duplicate message. Stories is just dumb and I have disabled it.	feature request

Still learning how to use it but like that it keeps all conversations in one place.	irrelevant information
It's great for free over wifi, but DO NOT, I repeat, do not get the Sim card and pay for the "monthly plan". They claim you get unlimited free calls and texts for the month and then you choose a plan to add data. But if you go over, say, the 2 or 3GB you purchased, they will also suspend your ability to make calls and texts. So I only used my "service" for about a week until they suspended my account and i could no longer even make calls or texts. False advertising, scam artists!	bug report
No customer privacy or confidentiality. Devs don't have a way to secure or encrypt communications. Joke of an app.	bug report

You know when they say if something is not broken don't fix it? This is literally how the latest UI update for mobile is. The layout is just rubbish, why did you change it. In a way though I must thank you because I'm spending less time on the discord app on my phone thanks to the new horrid layout. Edit: responding to the article, I understand this might be better fo mobile layout but the problem is, it feels clunkier than the previous design. 2nd edit: nah, still rubbish. Admit it's rubbish :)	feature request

Why does it lags like anything! Other call and message apps work like a charm and also why does the whole app open while receiving a call . Only shows the caller id after 10 seconds of the call	bug report
Shockingly slow with no signs of improvement in years. Almost all of the recent comments are one star and talk of poor performance. This hasn't changed in years and in 2024 is honestly unacceptable. Button response time is measured in seconds, UI elements get stuck with blank areas while the elements play catch up. Just genuinely unpleasant to use. Even using the Android keyboard has unnecessary input delay on the app, making spelling errors and mistakes a common occurrence. Fix it!	bug report

(changed from 5 stars to 1) These new layout changes for mobile is absolutely terrible, it's hard to switch between chats, it's not pleasing to the eyes, it doesn't do anything but make the app harder to use. It also won't even let me into the app. This app has gotten worse and worse, hopefully you will come to your senses and at least give us an option to change the layout. Not to mention that I get kicked out of calls when I play games with my friends. This is utterly ridiculous and annoying.	bug report

New UI is a pain to learn, but it has also come with a whole lot of problems that annoy the hell out of me. Voice Chat seems to freak out every now and then, especially on consoles. Discord itself doesn't load properly when I open it, either taking a minute or needing several restarts. Channels seem to glitch and only show me one specific channel, even in other servers. I keep getting notifications for channels that have no new messages.	bug report
This App Is Garbage!! They show adds everytime you send a message and its supper annoying. They make it hard to X out of it. They also try to track everything on your phone and is not conpatibale with vpn it will not let you make a phine call if you have one of these services and I am serious there are thousands of attempts to track everything you do.

First of all the two nitros are stupid, have one for a reasonable price (10$ and under a month) it's stupid to have 2 especially when no one gets the cheapest version. Second the mobile app is so buggy, the call cut off when you leave the app sometimes and restarts the app. Lastly the desktop one does not have the start a new line feature when using slash commands, so I'm forced to use my phone for that. Not to mention the privacy issues of your account not really deleting messages once deleted.	feature request

The application is up-to-date. I have good signal strength. Call connects, 30 seconds later call disconnect. This happens every time	bug report
Worst calling app ever. Every call breaks up and you have to guess at what the other person is saying and it's like that both ways you hardly ever get a completed call because it will disconnect randomly	bug report

Update 4: new spam call every hour or more. Update 3: Still inundated with spam calls. Update 2: Months later, incoming calls STILL aren't ringing through to devices. I'd hate to rely on this.

Original: Doesn't ring on all devices, doesn't always notify for messages, and I get **CONSTANT** spam/nobody calls at all hours of the day and night. Needs a "call whitelist" feature. Audio feeds back on calls.	bug report
GREAT APP!!! if you want to scream and throw your phone because of how many ads there are. Not even counting the amazing spam you get ... 24-7.  I mean you'll love it; if you enjoy trying to click a message but a ad "magically" popping up. I mean, every time I get on the ads move to what I'm about to click on. The ONLY reason I have it is to talk to my wifiless friend.	bug report

Guys don't use discord its full of bots. I just login into my account and update number before they let me into discord app . Discord straight away blocked me for messages that i didn't even send before even i logged in?? If i didn't logged in then how come i send messages. I hope discord get blocked on playstore as they did to me without my consent and knowledge even after i tell them i didn't send spam messages.	bug report
Delays in sending and receiving texts. Calls hardly ever ring through to me .

I wanted to see if the interface was as bad as people have said. It is. You have to put more effort into navigation than before, disrupting any flow you get yourself in. Not being able to leave the app outside of a server is a big issue. Bring back the area with both message and server list in one place. Let me swipe right to see who is online. Having to click the channel name for this is really disrupting and distracting. Worst update in a long time.	feature request

I do like it but i dont like the fact that it needs to be on wifi i thinks that's stupid but this is a good app but pls make it to where we can call and text off wifi because when i get home from shcool i need to call or text my mom telling her that i am on my way home and so that she can have the door open for when i get home. And thats is all i have to say.	feature request
It's okay but not as fast as I need	irrelevant information
Hey discord staff! I recently updated my app and noticed that the timestamps on messages no longer matches with my system preference (24-hour), is this a bug or a feature? Regardless I'd rather have the option between the 2 rather than being stuck with 12-hour time. Another thing is the animation for when you press on a reply, it sucks up battery life. Is there a way to revert it to the old one where it just jumps to the message instead of scrolls? Thanks for reading! Sincerely.	feature request
Fix your app. Account transfer doesn't work properly and when I enter in my phone number texts aren't getting sent. Fix it.	bug report
It's a good app to use but when in call with people on my computer the website crashes every few hours so I have to restart it and join back into the call which is irritating. It's been going on for months and every website on my computer has never acted like this so I know it's Discord.	bug report

So, I use this app daily and usually have no problems with it besides the usual shutdowns in the past. But, I use mobile lots and there's a bug with the decoration tab. I can't change or save any decorations because the save button for it is... off screen. I'm literally unable to click it. The text of the "Change Decoration" is so big that it's pushing the save button off screen. I tried reinstalling the app, logging out and making the text/font smaller, but nothing is working.	bug report

Great app but a pity that Signal is killing SMS integration. By default in Canada I assume I am sending an SMS. When sent through Signal often the message resolved as a Signal message, encrypted - WIN! Now I will send an SMS by the default Android app and never know if the recipient has signal... Shame!	feature request

This latest update is absolutely horrible. There is a delay now when opening channels, I can't tell when people message me directly because of the new tab structure on the bottom, I constantly have to force close the app then relaunch it in order to even see some of my servers and channels because the app isn't correctly loading servers and channels. This update was not optimized for mobile use.	bug report
Honestly, I hate this app. The app only updates when on wifi, and it's strange to give contact pic with name, but doesn't allow you to make app calls like on What'sApp. Very sad	bug report

Disappointed in the new update. When posting anything, the app does not update and it looks like nothing was posted. The visual, though fancy, is useless. The old version was a lot better sadly.	bug report

sluggish like it was written for a supercomputer, not a 2 yr old handheld. Every time I upgrade, this software gets slower and slower. please tell the devs to test UX on an 8 yr old Android. This isn't (anymore) rocket science	bug report
Tried to change the telephone number. Everything was okay, but then it said me that it can't determine the status of number changing, and I can't undo it and can't use the app at all. It's blocked!	bug report
Too security conscious. Keeps asking for pin code. Keeps updating, each time unlinking my PC signal app from my account. Annoying when transferring phones.	bug report
Love it except for when voice mail prompts that this number is a text me now number. I hate that feature I unfortunately have a bad boy syndrome and when I give my number out I only give my text me number it's great until they know it's a burn #. I would love for that to be removed to keep my safety, safer.	feature request
Hey, you guys have to tighten up. Using midjourney when trying use the describe feature to create a picture. When attempting to upload the picture instead of taking me to my photos, the word " image " pops up in red, I have to restart the app just to use it. Annoying	bug report
Sometimes it tends to not load messages or makes it incapable of tagging/mentioning peers but otherwise, a decent app to group chat. Just wish each individual could mute their own notifications and delete their own threads if they wish to. Right now if there is a way to so that, it is not clear.	feature request
Sometime their connection right now isn't working when ur networks or wifi works perfectly. And also you receive late text.	bug report
Everytime I want to search contact or use other menu it forced me to leave the application.	bug report
if i had this number for years and i use it daily, why must i get a message saying dont forget to call or send a text to someone or ill loose my number?	feature request

It was a great app until they decided to remove SMS support, even switched my mom over to it.

The new UI update is a catastrophe. Not only is it buggy as hell, but it is a straight downgrade in several key ways. The darker default theme is too high contrast to be readable for people with certain eye conditions, important options are tucked away behind unintuitive processes, and many different changes are simply baffling. Clearly the discord team has never heard the phrase: "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."	feature request
Great product!	irrelevant information
Alternative of imo, what's up	irrelevant information
please give "Export chat" option as in WhatsApp.	feature request

New UI is atrocious	feature request
There have been TWO updates that have entirely ruined my respect for this app. The first one being the layout change, but I still have yet to update the app because of the fear I feel. And two, this NEWER update is making it so people can't see images or profile pictures, and I can't see my banner that I paid for anymore, as WELL as it entirely ruined itself to the point of making it's community furious, gaining them so many bad reviews. Please fix your app before you loose more people.	bug report
I tried this with my moms phone and it had horrible call quality. It would repeat what is said. And she couldn't even hear me. There was also a bad *shriek*. Please fix for 5 stars	bug report

Dropping SMS is the worst decision y'all have made, somehow worse than the shitcoin thing. I might as well go to Session app at this point.

Incredible	feature request
It would be better if users could edit posts	feature request
Do to the information I've read on others review I've confidence on Skype id. And I can't download Skype id.	bug report
I really enjoyed the app but has 2 or 3 worst things I hate and no adjustments on it so far Firstly is the last SEEN of people you talk to either online or just left with the exaclay the time 2nd is the person who blocked you and when next you text someone back, we got the same 2 mark which others app shows one mark or blanks the profile to know the person has blocked you. I think that's the two things that always bothering me for now and you should adjust that because most of others apps did	feature request

This app gets worse with every update. It started off amazing when I joined in 2019. Now, it's slow and frequently disconnects. Stop trying to change the UI and fix the lagging issues.

This app is used by fake companies or impersonating real ones ! to scam people who are looking for remote work. Be safe. Don't give your personal information out. I'm not sure how secure this website is. But it's truly scary how easy it was to dupe me. I however e mail the actual company after I googled them and was told it was a scam. I'm giving two stars because this app may be can't help who reaches who. But then again. You guys make it easy so I dunno.	irrelevant information
This app help me a lot wen I don't have money to pay my phone bill üôÉ thanks	irrelevant information
Cool and good	irrelevant information
It has way to many adds with the free version. It's like they want you to pay for getting a sim card to make sure you have the number permanently; but I don't need it permanently, I just need it for a short time. What I do like is when you get a new number your messages stay from other numbers, they have that going for them. And yes it is free n good service. You can hear the other person loud n clear dependant on your internet provider service. I would give this a 5 but the adds üëé	feature request

It'd not the same at all anymore I'm going to find a new app	bug report
I give it three stars because whenever o try to join a video call it slow to load the video picture, then it at times breaks up, or freezes in the middle of a conversation. But overall I can send messages without any problems. But it could be just an issue with my phone, because on my laptop it hasn't been a problem. But I haven't been able to use my laptop in a while because I need to have someone replace the battery on it so hopefully it still works once I do get the battery replaced.	bug report
Only notable feature is locked behind pay wall. Avoid.	feature request
I'll change it later	irrelevant information
Full screen video in landscape shows the title bar and ugly corners ( on a Samsung s21). It's also slow even on a fast phone. Trying to share a PNG image fails when you do that from Skype. These issues can be solved easily, but apparently nobody cares at Microsoft. It's a real pity, I like Skype much better than WhatsApp, but it seems Microsoft gave up on Skype.. Nobody at MS cares about this feedback also, so not sure why I bother to type this.	bug report
Ever since some updates a while back, I haven't been able to hear my friend's stream audio, but they can hear mine. Also I've had issues with their camera freezing during video calls even when my camera isn't on. I love Discord but this is really frustrating.	bug report

I have used discord 8-12 hours a day, for the past 4 years. Discord is my main form of communication, the only way that I talk with my friends and family overseas or around home. And Discord, I'm so disappointed in the new update. I havent updated my app, and I'm not going to. I see the new layout on friends phones- what is that? Where is my easy switch from a server to DM's? Where are my pinned images? Discord, your userbase likes the app because it ISNT like every other app. Dont change that.	feature request

Since SMS support is being removed, this is now a useless application. I've uninstalled it today, and just wanted to express my disappointment. There are so many other chat apps that are already vying for my attention. If I can't use this as an SMS app as well, it's worth nothing to me. I'm not interested in your enhancements. I just want a solid SMS app that allows secure communication with people who also have Signal.	feature request
Stops working then wants you to pay.	bug report
So confusing!!	bug report
Buggy and Broken. I used to not have any issues but now I get stuck in channels, I can't see some channels at all unless I restart, I can't delete or react most times bc it shows up as a thin line where I can't even read the text or see the options. Idk what happened but it's so bad now.	bug report
It is okay, for now. My friends and I have each tried making a new group on the app and it will not show on our groups. We get the notifications saying we have been added to a group, but the group is nowhere to be found. Please fix this asap!!	bug report

The new update took alotnto get used to and still is inconvenient, but also doesn't feel like it was designed for phones at all.

Lately, I can't get my minutes. They tell you to email them and I still haven't gotten minutes. WiFi calling sucks when phone is out of reach and so is texting. It really only works when phone is on, what's the point?	bug report
The new mobile ui is harder to navigate. Switching between dms and servers requires to many taps. And the pins no longer display images, but are also even less noticeable for those who are new to discord. One pro is discord will become less of a distraction for me when I am on my phone as I will be using it less.	feature request
Worsened UX across the board, worsened performance, in my case more clicks/actions needed to complete any of the flows I was using.	feature request
The app stopped sending messages when I'm on data. It only works on wifi for some reason.	bug report
How do I swipe Right? how do I see server members? how do I see people? is there a setting to bring it back??	feature request

Very bad experience. Everyone I called could not hear me and became frustrated even though it said Internet strength was excellent. Several times I tried to answer calls but it wouldn't do it and I lost the calls. You can't receive confirmation messages (ie you lost a password and they needed to confirm your telephone number) unless you pay for the subscription. This app sent me up the wall several times. This app took 4ever to load and required a lot of resources. I tried TextNow. Much better!	bug report

Hard to navigate, even harder to read text. The color scheme is not friendly. Dark mode is barely different than midnight mode and both are hard to read with astigmatism. Discord was once the gold standard for having a readable dark mode and for some reason the only accessible option was removed. The messages tab being along the bottom is fine but all the navigation regarding it is so much clunkier than previously. Also the permanent activity bar is like an annoying banner ad.	feature request

The sms you sent me was not working	bug report
Was a great app. Used it for years. Now useless for me now that SMS functionality has been removed. It's unnecessary overhead to have to use multiple apps when wanting to send a message and remembering who has Signal and who doesn't. Can't believe there wasn't a UX solution for indicating whether a message was encrypted or plain old SMS.	feature request

It's a safe spot	irrelevant information
I am a long time Signal user, I was upset by their recent decisions to end SMS support, and to include stories (because EVERY app needs a stories feature). Signal seems to be going downhill fast and I will probably be switching to one of their competitors.	feature request
Notifications were not getting on time. All other apps working fine. Setting also fine. Check the app once again. Otherwise I will uninstall it. Can't get any notifications at all. Getting the messages after 5 min of sending. Don't install it if you want fast replies from your friends .	bug report

I like it (5*), however, I had to delete the app and reinstall it and I lost all my conversations and images, etc. I don't see where to back all this up so that it is not lost next time! I will give 5* again when I get a proper response from developers.	bug report

Great app. I now use this app for my business number for my little car dealership that I have. This has been my business number for 2 years now. So far its still a good app, but now I be trying to figure out why is there a delay when talking to people on the phone, I'm hoping this doesn't continue	bug report
If you download this app your device will be hacked cuz the whole text now and text free has been hacked by an apple device who's able to receive any information as soon as you download this app and also text free app is another one DO NOT DOWNLOAD	irrelevant information

This app should be pulled. It will hold important messages hostage unless you give the maker money, and all under the lie of doing it for the users security. Be warned, if you use this app for app for password resets, they will not give you access until you pay them. It'll work for other messages, giving you a false sense of trust, but if determines that an incoming text is for resetting a password for whatever you've gotten locked out of, you won't see it until paying the ransom.	bug report

Latest update makes it difficult to use the app. Trying to navigate between servers and DMs adds additional steps along with having to kill app and reopening every time I try to swap between any. Connectivity seems to be shotty now too. Not sure how they managed to go backwards so quickly with the app.	bug report
It nice I use it a lot but sometimes it freezes texts which takes them long to say and it also doesn't show text when someone says something it takes longer for me to get the text	bug report
It's nice I like it	irrelevant information
Beware!!! The moment I installed and opened the app it somehow charged my credit card. I didn't give them any of my info but they still charged me.EDIT they messaged me back that I will never be charged yet they charged my card $50 and they still have pending charge of $1 which means they will keep my card open to charge more. I would rather handle any disputes with my bank directly rather than giving these crooks any of my personal information.	bug report

It's a good app for texting you don't have to use data, you can use everyone from your contacts list, you only have to use Wi-Fi but, the only downside for me I don't know if it depends on how far away the person is that is texting you or if your device itself but there is a 3 minute delay in between me sending a text and the other person receiving it and also somebody sending me a text and then me receiving it.	bug report

Discord is full of crypto bots that promise big returns to manage users cryptocurrency but will rip the useer off given the chance so if the potential user doesn't fall for those scams they're onto a really good socialmedia platform that will build confidence in being social on socialmedia which other socialmedia platforms fail at, some of the socialmedia platforms are friends only by appointment media and that gives Discord the advantage, it also has the option to call other Discord users.	irrelevant information
Convenient and Useful and Easily Manuverable	irrelevant information
Excellent for privacy and ease of use. Unfortunately here in early 2023 the devs went too far off the ideological deep end and alienated tons of users by removing SMS support instead of clearly marking which messages are and are not secure. So now you'll need a totally separate app for normal texts, as this only works with special encrypted Signal texts.	feature request

The new updated mobile discord ui is very bad, chats will still present in the text field despite being send. Clicking the server btn to change between servers does not change the chat. Worst part is that messages could not be send and loading chats is simply unbearable, pls fix the issues quickly asap	bug report
discords great and all but genuinely the new UI is so bad. it makes basically everything harder to find. dms are a completely new tab for some reason, message searching is now constrained to the chat youre in, and you cant swipe over in servers to see members anymore. that last one is incredibly annoying. why would you make it harder to view members? and you have to go into the channels settings to even see the channel topic so its pretty much useless now. discord why do you hate your users??	feature request

Straight up GARBAGE! If it was an option, I would've gave this app NO STARS. Ever since I paid for the 1.99 to receive 100mins, the app got worse. I sit close by my wifi router and its having issues to connect. I am the only person in my home using the wifi and the only device I use it for is my PHONE. Nothing else. Why the issues occurred right after I paid for 2 dollars for 100 mins?? Its costing me mins as well. What a complete rip-off.	bug report
It is creepy	irrelevant information
It's a mess. For both phone and computer, it's always seemingly having this "Connection," issue, which causes me to have to close and open the app a second time for it to work properly. It slows down when I look through my gallery and takes forever to send the pictures out, even IF you have good battery. On computer? The app is HORRIBLE with streaming (w/ Nitro too!) and it's slow as hell when you stream even the smallest of games.	bug report
It took over 20 min for my IT person to set this up. Then I turned off my phone and the app erased all of my peeps! What a joke!	bug report

Needs more fine controls. Sometimes, there's too much chatter in the group, which results in "dings" that really only a handful of people are interested in. Hierarchical notification choices--choosing a subset within a group to receive notifications from 'always,' 'seldom,' or that you have to opt in to, would be a significant improvement. Without that? I'm mostly going to choose to leave the app on "silent."	feature request

Whenever I try to send a message and my service is spotty this app can't handle it. It either sends me several failure messages or just sits there spinning its wheels and doing nothing even when I get back in strong service. Usually I just have to cancel a message and resend in. Every other app has solved this problem, why do I have to babysit Signal to make sure my messages actually send? Considering I live in NY and am frequently messaging while on the subway this is particularly annoying.	bug report
How do I use this on my lap top?	irrelevant information
I give it a two because originally this app worked great but for the past while it would log me out of what I was reading/writing for no real apparent reason.. It won't hold the conversion open and closes either out of that or the app completely and randomly	bug report

This app has worked flawlessly for years, but I simply can't understand why they would be ending SMS support. What does Signal have that Telegram does not? They will surely lose the majority of their users by doing this.	feature request
Latest update breaks so many things. Tapping on a notice that someone replied to your message can leave you completely stuck & have to kill the app. Can only search within a single channel at a time now on each server. Frequent visual glitches that you have to keep rotating or changing channels to fix. Embedded thumbnails of videos hosted on Discord servers are all broken. Many little things changed unnecessarily & made worse than before. Canceling Nitro until they stop breaking things.	bug report

Liked the old UI a lot better + I've been having constant bugs trying to see messages and on other channels and servers after the one I opened the app too and I even have to get out and back into the app to see new msgs in that channel itself. Rarely different since I updated the app, maybe once it worked properly at all. Peeved with dc keeping on changing features the userbase loved and were memorable and people had few issues with. I get keeping up w the times, but there's a difference to this	feature request

My friends get a message saying that messaging is blocked. They can see my messages but can't reply ...	bug report
This is definitely one of the best apps ever has I can call and show my camera, mute and deafen myself. Although, there has been a glitch on my device where sometimes when I try to join a voice call and play Roblox, Discord sometimes just randomly leaves the call, without telling me or doing anything to warn me about it. This is why I rate this app 4 out of 5 stars.	bug report

discord never listens to our feedback! i ALMOST gifted nitro for xmas, this update makes me unwilling to support a company that wastes money. many bugs. not enough space to write them here. still have to mute and unmute to start audio. newest update changed everything around, made things even slower and more awkward.. still has audio bugs etc affecting everyone i know. this latest change is really poorly thought out. more clicks to do things that were easy. disconnects. send fails. bad ux.	bug report

Very confusing on how to set up and add contacts when switching devices.	feature request
This app has gotten worse over the years. It used to be good quality when I am an a call. Know it just kinda gotten laggy and tons of adds, and the sound is getting worst. I also have pure wifi over here and my phone is pretty good as well. So it's probably not those two.	bug report
App is still usable, but takes longer to start up. New UI is horrendous compared to the old one, having to switch tabs basically to go from dms to servers. It just feels slower in general when operating the app.	feature request

This app is great for keeping my 20 immediate family members in touch with each other.

Nice idea, but poor functionality Can't watch stream/broadcast most of time it just sits spinning/buffering with black screen I can't react to messages I randomly get disconnected and have to disconnect and rejoin The idea behind Discord is great but they need to work on making it actually functional instead of messing with constantly changing the interface. Please focus on it being able to function instead of how pretty it looks	bug report
Just heard about their crypto debacle. I would have paid monthly but now I'm looking for a replacement app. Once again money ruins something good. Orig review: What "sold" me on this app is that it is open source and it has perfect forward secrecy. Love the desktop integration using a keyboard so I don't have to crab out messages with my thumbs like I'm doing now which SUCKS. This app and the people behind it are doing their part to legalize freedom and we all owe them a huge debt of gratitude.	feature request

Hey why can't see previous pictures in dm! I already update but still not norma	bug report
Whelp, new mobile layout is mid. Time to switch to desktop only. Upon reading many other reviews, it sounds like discord needs to admit their mistake and just change the ui back to the previous one. I'll be honest even having to go change my settings to fix it is an unnecessary hassle. At least make the old ui the default	feature request
After the new ui, the experience became dreadful. I can't mute or unsure people in calls. The navigation is awful, and there is no way to bring back the old interface. The app keeps getting updated, and nothing is fixed.	feature request
I really hate this app. The setup process and ability to connect to others is gravely flawed. I have gotten unsolicited contact from people I have never met, and who should not have my information, but I am not able to connect a contact from a friend's personal invite. That makes zero sense. GroupMe fails at its primary function: providing a way to connect and communicate with others. Do not download this app! I would give it zero stars, but the Play Store doesn't allow for that.	bug report

Its very good except for the fact every time i tru to call it never is able to connect	bug report
Great app for groups without giving too much personal information away!	irrelevant information
Had to stop using this app and switch to text free because this app for some reason doesn't ring on phone calls until after the caller has already hung up. This has been a issue for some time, not only that but also text alerts don't come through until you open the app 90% of the time. Mind you I have 5g data plus great wifi connections. Not even just that the caller always complains they can't hear me talking so if you're looking for a second number app choose a different one take my word.	bug report
This new update is awful. You can no longer see where you were mentioned in servers, and swiping left now replies to a message instead of showing you members online. This is definitely geared towards people who aren't in many servers or are only in Dm's. Not to mention their support site is actually useless.	feature request

I used to love and praise Signal, and was were pleased with it's functions. However, removing SMS support turns this to yet another messaging app that divides people instead of offering a single app that works for every contant. Such a sad direction Signal's heading- instead of standing out as the perfect messaging app, it will just blend in with others.	feature request

It's kind of dumb because you still have to pay to be able to leave messages unless you  update it and you can't have voice mail unless you pay for it  I thought it was called text free	bug report
Great App. Would be nice if you could edit within minutes of sending as fat thumbs and autocorrect can be a dangerous mix	feature request
Love the app, my only issue is the amount of ads. This doesnt bother me to much, because its to help you gain money, BUT, its to the point where it lags out sometimes. I have no other issues with it than it being to the point of lagging out.	feature request
Good app but notifications are delayed by 5-10 mins sometimes. For time sensitive notifications, this is really annoying.	bug report
A bit strange user interface - you don't know at first where to press for calling, you search for a handset, then speaker is ON when someone answers...so unusual, bad user experience for using the program on mobile device. UI like made just to be different - l don't like it! Also searching for other users could be much better. But otherwise OK for cheap communications.	feature request

Constant updates on desktop version, updates on droid version make it where contacts who do not have Signal, can't send me photos/video messages. I use to really like this app, but every time an update comes out, my "like" for this app falls further and further down the drain. I'm ready to abandon Signal and encourage others to do the same. I want my permissions back for my default app to be able to accept mms/sms messages whereas signal has hijacked them , STOP with the endless useless updates.	bug report

I liked this app until the news that they are dropping SMS. Will never be able to entice anyone to switch to it now for all the reasons others have said. My other gripe is that I have only been able to attach one picture per message, requiring multiple texts to send two or three pictures. Guess that doesn't matter any more. I'll hold onto it for a while in case the people at Signal sober up and restore SMS functionality but until they do it is basically worthless.	feature request

The new themes and UI aesthetic design Discord implemented look great. The problem is the user-friendy navigation for mobile users is gone, the layout that made Discord such a breeze to use on mobile is gone, optimization is terrible. Primarily, the mindless and easy way anyone could swipe to what they need next, it requires no focus or effort, which is why many apps nowadays implement swiping mechanics into their apps. To optimize Discord for mobile, easy access swiping should be implemented.	feature request

After the "update," not good anymore. Skype on Samsung S9+ and on an iPad. iPad will ring when a call comes through but not the Samsung phone. Then after a minute while talking on Skype from iPad, Skype on the Samsung will start ringing for the call that I am already on. And as everyone else stated, you cannot get rid of the badge notification unless you turn off notifications. Would have given it 1 star but will give it the benefit of doubt that it is related to new Android os version.	bug report

So I have to constantly scroll through the previous texts of the contact to figure out who it is. This is annoying, please fix	bug report
I like this app  but it would be better if they made it like imessege	feature request
Discord is great but when I play a game while I'm on a call discord stops the call which makes me have to go back to discord to join the call again	bug report
I have always really loved the discord app, and the regular updates were generally appreciated, but this latest update has really been a step backwards. My biggest complaints are that it has disrupted the navigation flow that the app had before, and I don't want to see notifications about what other peiple are doing ar the top of my nessage list. Discord, please return things to the way they were before, until then I'll be cancelling my nitro.	feature request
Spam... ive given the number i chose to no one yet im constantly getting spam calls. Annoying.. deciding whether ill keep the app.	bug report

This app is so so pathetic, I don't know how Elon Musk recommended this app to the public to message. No wonders, he also was sure that this app is going to be of same condition as Twitter is. This Signal app literally sucks. There is so much of lag in sending out the messages, the delivery of the message the video calling and everything sucks. By the time your message gets read or double tick, the person in front switch to other message, you loose the flow. Who so ever is the developer, u suck	bug report
there are ALWAYS issues sending my messages.	bug report
Great way for our group to keep on contact!	irrelevant information

Good app but when I close out the app and don't get rid of the tile I can't hear audio	bug report
Lag so much lag Not as smooth as before	bug report
It works well when communicating with smartphone and PCs.	irrelevant information
Discord is good. It doesn't crash randomly anymore. Just that sometimes no one can hear me even when I'm unmuted. It's not common, but very annoying.	bug report
I haven't used it that much.	irrelevant information
The previous UI was unique in it's own way, but after the update the app looks like some kind of cheap messaging app, the navigation is too much of a trouble, the bugs where the buttons become hidden due to a landscape wise screen and many more. To be honest it doesn't feel like Discord anymore. I wouldn't be mad if they return the previous UI . That was more clean and easy to navigate/use. Other features are commendable at some point but the UI.... Sadly this is really disappointing...	feature request
It's a great app if you have an Android device or phone	irrelevant information
Great app, unfortunately it won't be supporting sms going forward. There's no way I can get all of my contacts on signal or expect new contacts to have it. Going forward I won't use this app but the normal crummy texting app which is unfortunate.	feature request
i love this app been using it for over a year but i got direct msgs that i wud like to delete that are super old. of ppl i dont talk to no more and hiding msg by msg is too much please have an option also a option to block ppl you dont want to direct message you especially stalkers..smh	feature request

Uploading images in channels is quite buggy. Some times they are upload as cdn.discord links. And other times they properly send	bug report

I gave this app a five-star rating with a different email back in 2021 I gave it a different 5-star rating with a different email about 8 months ago I got rid of it because some parts will be coming annoying like people I don't know sending me things like mistress Odessa wanting me to be her slave but really didn't have any knowledge in the master or mistress slave game. I told her she needs to go back to playing marbles Jack's and hop scotch. Great now i want some Balvieney 18 year single malt.	irrelevant information
It just said connecting when trying to make a call and never connected to the call. Useless app basically!	bug report
Poor wifi(not your fault)	irrelevant information
This app doesn't recieve text messages for 2 step verification. Also calling doesn't work like normal phone service. When I called a gift card company to check a card balance it wouldn't recognize the numbers I was entering. I also get cut off alot during calls because some ads will open and end the call.	bug report
Slow and frustrating	bug report
The app will not send me notifications. The whole point of a messaging app is to get the notifications. Really wished this worked better.	bug report
this app is great but I wish I could use most of the things on there every time I pull up the tab to send a gift it just barely shows the tab same with my account settings I'm tired of deleting just for it to do it again and again it used to be a lot better.	feature request
Worst app I've used ever. This is the 2nd time I paid for a number and installed the app. Once I uninstall and reinstall, it won't let me login saying continue with Google account but never logs me in. Also, no way to cancel a number but getting billed continuously. They should have at least some way to contact support, unless they want me to dispute from the bank.	bug report
It's not getting connected at all. When I'm online it shows offline. We take screenshots and share it on WhatsApp. Ultimately end up calling on WhatsApp!	bug report
Don't be fooled. The police have access to any message sent through Signal including the "deleted" ones. Read the fine print.	irrelevant information
Calls don't go well. Calls either drop or I cannot be herd.	bug report
One star because we're almost to 2024 and Android tablets are not properly supported as "child" devices to our phones. This has been in place for iOS / ipadOS for years. I know that the devs are aware of this need and still have not addressed it yet. If/when that happens, this will be restored back up to its proper place with 5 stars. I'm frustrated by this still being an issue.	feature request
Would rate higher but it says free calls and none of the calls are free until calls are free I'll only rate it 3 stars	bug report
bro discord is so bad, my friend always stop listen to me and i need to restart the app, suddenly ends the call, it consume so much ram... i miss skype, i miss skype so bad...	bug report
Took a little work to set this up eventually got it working. This no longer works. Only pieces of msgs being rec'd. Some people receive nothing. Can't add new members. Nothing the Support Dept suggests fixes it. Wish it would work.	bug report

Great app, but one issue. Can't send any media files to anyone.	bug report
A really have a question. Can you only call using Wi-Fi?	feature request
Can't believe they dropped SMS. Used to be my go-to, but this alone was a first-to-worst move, then compounded by adding disgusto-nasty unwanted distraction "feature" (tho Idk to whom this is a feature) of stories.

1. The fact i cannot pay with a skype credit (gift card) is a real problem! 2. not being able to use custom ring tones is a issue! 3. not being able to use third party faxing is a problem! 4. not being able to export my contacts internal to other platforms is a issue! I've used skype for over 12 years and immediately after Microsoft bought the company many features were lost. The push to integrate into Office is leaving many of us that use it as a VOIP user considering other platforms.	feature request
Just too good	irrelevant information
The best more people should donate!! The service signal provides us is a gift. No ads no forced to pay. Only true private service that exist, look at your permissions. They do all this for us. I never realized how much, how grateful we should be. I guess in summary, it's our 1 escape from Google and Big Tech. I'm not rich, but I hope this is motivation for someone to at least give a dollar. I'm in noway affiliated with signal. Just never realized how grateful we should be for a service like this	irrelevant information

Why need to get nitro just for a background???	feature request
I love this app as it helps me connect with the people I love. However, lately it's been... sub par? Controlling itself is the worst issue. The chat menu opening and closing itself, the tiniest touch miscalculation opening the emoji keyboard 3 times by itself, making my keyboard crash, words doubling themselves or correcting themselves no matter where they're put in the sentence.... And this is all ONLY on discord. And i am not the only one having these issues. I hope it gets patched. and soon.	bug report
Discord app was great until the new forced UI update. It is now almost unbearable and beyond frustrating. Takes way too long to do the same tasks as before and is now an unorganized mess. This is what happens when these social apps decide to be like everyone else instead of their own unique entity.	feature request
Cant recieve verification codes for free? This app is now officially ruined for me and this was the main reason im using this. Edit: makes sense now	bug report
Gif keyboard isn't working. It keeps saying "something went wrong" every time I try and use a gif.....	bug report

The app does stop working randomly and crash here and there but besides that I love it!!!	bug report
I've been proudly using Signal since it launched but am now experiencing a problem. When I access a voice note it starts playing, but as soon as I put my Samsung device next to my ear it stops playing and when I go back to it and click on it nothing happens - it does not want to play - even through the speaker. I then have to exit the app and go back in to listen to it. My app and phone is updated to the latest versions. This does not happen with WhatsApp voice notes.	bug report
Absolutely the worst messaging app for syncing to secondary devices. Erases my entire message history on laptop with every upgrade. Support has no solution. I wish my colleagues would stop using this	bug report
Doesn't show new notifications and messages. I constantly have to check for new messages.	bug report
Why in tarnation would you remove SMS support? It was one of the strong points of this app, especially in regards to the ability to back up messages when migrating to a new phone. The emptiness in the reasoning is baffling, too. I second the notion that social media shoud remain social media. Don't care for "stories" in a messenger app. Someone is making poor decisions over there.	feature request

Great for chatting with several people. Only wished it allows you to upload an image that isn't in jpeg function. I am having problems with sending messages.

Discord has reached a new low. The new UI is brutal for anybody who uses threads. It shouldn't be this hard to toggle between threads in the same channel. Worse, voice calls don't work at all. Nobody can hear me. The microphone only works for voice messages in text channels.	feature request
Edit#4 still no real response from discord devs. I am sent in a circle and told I am providing feedback to the wrong place. Not sure why discord is failing this hard but I will uninstall the app soon if I cannot use the old original layout. Edit#5 the help article being commented on all these reviews does not help. Edit#6 they continue to direct me at a help article which is not helpful. The automated response makes the experience even worse. We are being ignored.	bug report
No ability to add password or a pin to lock the app.	feature request
Shuts down Everytime I try to use it. I have to copy my text from somewhere else and paste it to send a text. Then it shuts down after I hit send. If I try to type it takes the first few words before it shuts down and I have to force close.	bug report

When someone calls me I only find out about it if I go to the app and check for messages, which could be hours after the attempted call. It will rarely give a notification of an incoming call. EDIT: I wrote that review some time ago and the service has improved immensely since then. It's a great app, very reliable. Thanks!	feature request
Was working very well until the update. Now when I send a text or recieve one, I have to wait a long time for it to load, neer had this issue before the update. Other than that issue, I love this app.	bug report

After this latest update, the pictures aren't downloading....	bug report
One of my favorite messaging apps. Love the focus on privacy and being open source, but was disappointed when they removed the ability to communicate with non Signal users. I understand the change was to push for the end-to-end encrypted messages, but I feel like they could have left us with the option to send unencrypted texts. Unfortunately most of the people in my social circle don't use Signal, so I had to uninstall.	feature request

This is probably the most inconsistent app that I've ever used on a mobile device since I bought the first device that has apps on it. STOP RADICALLY CHANGING LAYOUTS AND FEATURES. Inconvenient and unnecessary things are put in the forefront, more important things are removed from sight. The user list gesture is replaced with a reply gesture, even though reply is still where it always was, on a long press. Stop trying to make platforms act the same. This isn't an apple device.	feature request

Had a subscription for over a year. Now my number changes everytime I open the app. I'll change my rating if this is resolved. Update: My number was returned AFTER I unsubscribed. So backwards but I'll add 2 more stars to my rating. Update: after they restored my number for a week, they changed it again before it could expire. This is too much trouble.	bug report
It is nice to connect with coworkers at this time	irrelevant information
This application is having bug. Its confusing contacts with same first name and last name but different middle name, and displaying all those contacts under one contact address. You guys need to fix this issue. How can developers at Microsoft make such mistakes? You need to include middle name text field in the contact form of this application. These are the basic thing we learn when we start learning programming. I am shocked that nobody reported this bug before.	bug report

Not happy with the recent update. The main thing driving me nuts is how much slower it is to load. It's also sluggish when moving to-and-from messages and servers. I also preferred the old layout but I think with a few changes this one can be good. I'm giving it 3 stars vs 1 (like the rest of ya! Hahaha) because I'm not that upset about it. I will still use the free version and update my rating if it improves.	bug report
I hate this app!!!! It declines all your calls and when it does let you call it hangs up on the person and dosnt let you call again.	bug report
Whats going to be funny is when you take a new number but have to check signal to see if their number is compatible. I'm just going to deactivate it on my families phones and recommend they tell their friends to deactivate it too or they may not get their messages. Dont just delete this app, deactivate it first or it will hold your messages since they wont be delivered to a phone number address.	irrelevant information

God awful update to the ui why did they move everything around and make servers have a different tab? Why did they change the search function. This has gone from a streamlined and easy to use app to one of the worst and clunkiest experiences with a layout I've had. Don't update your app if you still have the good version.	feature request
Long time user switching because Signal stopped supporting SMS. Who wants two messaging apps? Bummer	bug report
What is this new update? I absolutely hate it. I hate not being able to swipe left to see my servers and have the DMs immediately be right there. I hate the banner above the DMs screen taking up so much space. I hate not being able to swipe right to view who's online in a server. I hate that I can't turn off the voice message button because I keep accidentally hitting it and it messes with my audio on my device.

Fix the app. Other than the new update making the app much more clunky and difficult to navigate, I'm having issues with glitches and lag. The search feature doesn't even work properly anymore. The app crashes much more now. Before I never had any issues with the app running slow or lagging, but now I am. With this, among other various things, I don't see why anyone thought this new update was a good idea. I'm not joining a hate train for the update. I genuinely am having issues with it.	bug report
at first I thought this TextNow was a solid company but in trying to get a small refund from them I've changed my mind. they claim that they can't issue refunds if you want a refund from an in-app purchase you have to do it through Google. and if Google doesn't want to issue the refund there's nothing you can do even though TextNow is the one collecting the money for the purchase they're not willing to contact Google to tell them to issue the refund. I heard back from TextNow 4 months later.!	feature request
Hi i used to be a frequent user and nitro supporter since 2017 but since the reccently implementation of the ui updates i have 0 motivation to fully utilize the app due to the unfriendly look is extremely grating on the eyes. as a visually impaired person i am considering canceling future nitro subscriptions and probably not buying anything from the shop for now due to the unwilling support refusing to let the disabled have much say in this.

It's a great concept and a very useful messaging platform, but some major bugs make it hard to use. Notifications are hit or miss and are never sent for dm's. New groups and dm's sent to me don't show up in the chat view until days later. / Edit: The app NO LONGER WORKS AT ALL. Chats I am added to do not show up in my messages list even WEEKS later. I tried clearing data and updating - it just says "Welcome" with NO MESSAGES. FOR A WEEK. After years of use, it's time to say goodbye to GroupMe.	bug report
Nice but i prefers the old version cs the latest updates sucks. It tooks so long to load too although my WiFi is good enough and its not really smooth and confusing sometimes. Ive been using this app from dec 2021 like that and its great back then.	bug report

I have been using Discord to keep in touch with friends and family for 6 years and this newest update has me seriously considering just texting them instead. While I appreciate servers and DMs being more separate now, the new dark mode is much higher contrast and I have begun to experience headaches while using it. Any theme that's easier on my eyes costs money, something disabled people are not particularly known to have.	feature request

Have to update the rating for the app, as the service itself works and I like it, but when It comes to the mobile app this is simply unusable. I'm not complaining about the UI change which is something that someone may like it or not, but the slowness that the app has reached is truly unbelievable. It takes years to answer to a message from mobile, it simply stutters and sometimes I need to tap multiple times to open a chat.	bug report
I love Signal, but as only a handful of friends and relatives use it, and as the app has stopped accepting texts to/from non-Signal users (extremely counter intuitive and counter productive moves on Signal Foundation's [previously Open Whispers'] part), I may have to use this previously-superior app less and less.	feature request

It's not a great experience tablets. The text field often expands of the screen when in portrait mode, making the send, emoji, and voice note button inaccessible. The most recent update also seems to have removed the 'AMOLED' dark mode option from the appearance settings. If you use the "memory lane" appearance on other devices and have 'sync across clients' enabled, attempting to change will cause the app to crash. How has one update managed to make the user experience worse?	bug report
On the current version I can no longer sign in. The password I use on the web app fails on Android. Groupme support simply gave me a password reset link. That didn't help because I have a valid password. The Android app simply will not let me sign in.

I love Discord, don't get me wrong, but seriously the new update ruins most of the features I loved about it and made it a standard copy and paste social media website.

I actually love the convenience of this app. My youth group uses it to communicate. A common issue for us is that we don't always receive notifications. I personally don't. I'm trying the uninstall/reinstall method now. It's just frustrating to randomly decide to check the app to see that you're 30 messages behind and missed the conversations.	bug report

Signal's decision to remove SMS pretty much ruins their USP to have encrypted messaging and sms with non signal users under a single UI. It's not a secure decision. It's unbelievably dumb and short sighted considering how many tech savvy users have convinced their grandmas to use this app. Suddenly next month a bunch of tech illiterate relatives will be wondering why they can't send or receive messages with their friends.	feature request
I like the app but, it loads slow, eventually when it loads I can send a text just fine. It just bothers me when I'm in a rush. Other than that it's pretty good.	bug report

Cannot receive texts - locks all SMS verification behind a paywall. EDIT1: I have contacted Pinger Reviews after they have reached out to me. Still waiting for a reply.

I've been having issues with Skype recently. I have a Galaxy S9 and since the September update it has been having issues showing video in picture of myself or the person I'm contacting.

Well I appreciate discord cause it's literally my only media platform (& I prefer it that way) but I'm there is a serious problem with forums. You see I can open a forum & it will be alright but if the original or first message associated with the forum is on my screen it instantly crashes discord. I had to uninstall & reinstall discord 3 times because of it & it's just upsetting since alot of servers are implimenting or migrating to forums. Please guys find a way to fix this. 4 stars though.	bug report

I loved the app, but when the new layout came out it confused a lot of people including myself. My friends hates the new layout, and I have to say so do I, its supposed to be easier to navigate but it makes it a hundred times harder. I liked the old layout better or when you had the option between layouts. As much as I love discord and having it to communicate with friends, I really dislike the layout.

Mobile's never been worth 5 stars. It's always been buggy. But with the new update, bugs aren't the only issue anymore. While most of it's just "different" and change can be uncomfortable, there are some things that are simply "worse" too. 1) Dark mode's too dark. My sibling has astigmatism; the new dark mode messes with their eyes. And no, light mode isn't better. 2) Things that used to be intuitive simply aren‚Äôt anymore or take too many more steps. There's obviously more, but character limits.	feature request

Atrociously incompetent Support team, especially Trust&Safety team. And insufficient standards of triage and prioritisation. If your account gets hacked, you can expect it a permanent loss. They took 2 months to even respond to the support ticket, by which time the hacker had deleted it. And don't bother following it up with a follow up support request, as that will throw your support ticket father back in the queue. Forget about them prioritizing your safety first.	bug report

Well, it still works, sort of. As long as someone else signs up for signal you two can message each other. Makes NO SENSE to me but i don't work there. And i didn't make the change to downgrade the messaging app to only work here and there because you'll only find people here and there who have signal. It's bs, whoever thought it was good idea to remove the actual thing that it's supposed to do is an idiot imo. Again, want me that decided to remove signal's texting capabilities.

Discord is a great service at its core and I've been a nitro sub for years, but they're constantly fiddling with things in the app that break your muscle memory in a very frustrating way, with no option to revert back to the classic layout which resembles the desktop version.

I don't want to swipe right to reply, I want my search history back, and I want my dms to be where they've always been	feature request
No, no, no. You guys somehow make the app worse with every single update. the previous layout of the mobile app was perfect as it was, and nobody asked for this update. The way that the app resembled the desktop version with minor differences was perfect, but it looks and behaves like an entirely different website now. Please, do us all a favor, and stop majorly changing the way your app looks. Stop 'fixing' something that isn't broken.	feature request

free calls and texts as long as you have wifi	irrelevant information
better performance now, still nowhere near the old ui speed though :( hopefully it improves in a couple years.... lol	irrelevant information
If I didn't have to use it because of my community, I wouldn't. You have download a video 10 times to succeed, and you can't save it at all. It automatically turns off wifi. It's just awful.	bug report
It's good. I can talk not only with friends but with community's too. But I'm experiencing where images I send show up bigger then I inspected and appears glitched	bug report

Discord is great, and I've used it for years, but I recently got the update with the new UI, and I really dislike it. If there's a way to go back to the old one I'd change my review to probably 4 or 5 stars	feature request
It's an okay app for quickly starting in touch with a small group. I personally don't like a running feed, especially where the comments ebb and flow from day to day. I would prefer to "REPLY" to comments of my choosing, especially if I don't get to respond immediately - and by the time I do, the conversation had already shifted. I also do NOT like being UNABLE TO EDIT any message - or again, post an immediate "reply" to my original post to correct anything. Okay, I guess I don't like the app...	feature request
It was great at first. Until I couldn't receive any messages unless I wait for like an hour or more or restart my phone.	bug report
Removing SMS support is an unwise decision. This app served as a single platform for both secure and insecure contacts. Without SMS it will be yet another separate chat app no one will use. I plan on uninstalling once that happens.	feature request
It's ok. Would like to add blur or green screen to the video Skype call. Also, voices are having feedback issues.	feature request
Works well, app works great on Linux desktop distros (rare), but interface and emojis need an upgrade. Feels a bit like an app from 4 years ago.	feature request

Functionally has dropped substantially over time, both on the mobile app, and on desktop. Bugs are far more common over time, and most require closing the app and relaunching, sometimes multiple times, to try to fix them. The app used to be very good, with very few issues. That's just not the case anymore.	bug report

I tryed to call 911 but i could'nt because i had to wait for the ads to finish .	bug report
Honestly, this app has helped me out of a bit of a tight spot. I lost my job and was suddenly unable to afford my phone bill so I did some searching for cheap phone plans. This popped up, seemed too good to be true, but I bit the bullet and ordered their SIM. Service is satisfactory, ad's aren't intrusive and everything works as it should with no dropped calls or missed texts.	irrelevant information

I'd love to give pinger 5 stars but there's a huge flaw in the programming. I see now that if you text from the computer and text from your phone later the messages won't be there. Even if I refresh my phone, restart it, turn it off.. My messages are gone. Only showing messages from the past few days. I had to download the old text free just to see what my friends were texting. Please fix this and I'll fix your rating Pinger!	bug report

I have been using signal for years and it works pretty well despite the occasional hiccups. I'm still not sure if I trust it though. Lots of financial ties to questionable entities.

The latest update changed the layout and it's really bad and inconvenient. For anyone else who, like me, is angry at the new layout, don't worry, YOU CAN CHANGE IT BACK. Simply go to your settings, then in appearance, then switch off "new layout". It's still pretty sad i had to go looking around instead of getting actual help from the app review customer service.	feature request

Something is big time wrong with this app above and beyond it's normal quirks. It's showing the same chat log for multiple different servers and messages.	bug report
I was banned quickly from this app for no reason other than I tried logging in from different browsers and was having issue. No VPN, IP is not blacklisted. For this reason alone, I consider this app worthless as it's unreliable.	bug report

No way that I have seen to edit contacts picture or number if they change numbers. Other than that, call quality has always been good for me.I will most likely keep for an extra number.

Since the upgrade, It is horrible with phone calls out going & incoming.

Litterally cannot be uninstalled. Just went to uninstall it and it showed me it was being uninstalled then jumped to "open" and "update" Forced software on devices is litteral a garbage.	bug report

Good but need morr development & update to can see the status & seen like whatsApp	feature request
Great experience every use	irrelevant information
Does what it says, but never got the free 60 mins?? And also a lot of the time I try and call it wont complete because of a poor connection and when it does work the call breaks up. As well as when you send a text it will fail but once you retry then it sends. Although, I'd say maybe like a third of the time it will have a great connection. So all in all, I am somewhat happy enough with this app that I will still continue to use it for at least a little bit longer, thats only if though nothing gets worse.	bug report
Can't get the number I was using back	bug report
Canceled my weekly subscription.... now many times a day a notification that appears over everything saying can't get payment... ya because I Canceled it......

More than 90 percent of the time I don't get immediate notifications which is rather annoying.	bug report
I like discord usually. But the mobile app has been becoming increasingly more glitchy since the update. I mean like channels not showing up my app randomly closing, it's a really huge inconvenience	bug report
It would be nice to have some more interactive features like lists, notes, polls that give the options to add items. Example: family members who are planning a gathering need an interactive checklist with the option of adding item as they go. A topic tag line to group messages would be good too. So you don't always have to create new groups.	feature request

Rediculously frustrating! Froze my whole phone every time I tried to make a phone call. Lagging, won't hang up, have to take my battery out to exit the app, and won't let any calls go through after the second call I made after installing this app. Takes a million years for my texts to go through! Waste of time and space.	bug report
It would be alright, except you can't copy and paste from messages. It's suppose to help you communicate with people, but doesn't let you copy and paste part of a message? Got a restaurant name you want to share? Too bad, you're pasting that whole message into Google maps. Gah.	feature request
I like TextNow I really in joy	irrelevant information
Normally i would rate this app or anything like it at 3, 4 stars however there seems to be a bug that im pretty sure was introduced in one of the updates. The bug: in dms only, images can get sent and are visible until i go to zoom in or view by selecting an image. At which point, it greys out. I didnt have this issue before.	bug report

App is very, very slow, takes a minute to change between pages, it takes ages to get loaded. A poor app.	bug report
This app is nice for social interacting, but sometimes it has annoying bugs. In the new update, when you click on a server too quickly and then switch to another sever the chat from the other server is still gonna be there and to remove it you have too close the whole app. And the second one that's actually very very annoying me is the one when you try and log back in it says "Oops you caught an ultra rare error" and it doesn't let me log in. Please do something about this.	bug report
Can't even make a account	bug report
This app stinks!!! I can't make phone calls unless I am connected to wifi even after I have spent almost 50 bucks for a subscription plus money on the phone and money to have it ad free. I only paid so much because I wanted the talk and data which doesn't work. Will never recommend this app	bug report
Didn't let me connect to some of the chats	bug report
The app is alright but it can use some updates. It goes in-&-out even with excellent wifi. And I can't activate my sim card. Everytime I click "active your sim card", it takes me back to what I was on before I clicked, "active your sim card". But it's alright because it still let's me make calls, even if it's 10 minutes later. Warm regards, Alexis Smith ü´Äü´∂üèæ !	bug report

[UPDATE] I set the auto delete feature for 1 week on 1 person and 1 day on another. Both stopped working in August. It deletes the other person on my end, but my messages are still there. [OLD REVIEW] Seems decent, but as mentioned before, you can't delete your messages for everyone in chat after a certain amount of time passes; it becomes permanent. You can delete your messages on your end, but the other person keeps your messages.	bug report
It was fine even with the ads but now there are ads that open windows in the middle of calls and end the call. It barely works now. Just use something else.	bug report
I wish I could give a 9.5 out of ten...I understand that bugs will happen...only reason I didnt give 5 Love the service for voice calls while gaming, chatting, chilling roleplaying and many things ...love using Discord just sometimes have issues that are easily fixed by restarting the app or checking settings after an update!!	feature request
Great app, except sometimes I can't hear people and they can't hear me and I need to reinstall the app alot	bug report
It works, but it hasnt changed in 20 years, or added anything cool during the pandemic, so, when you feel like taking your eyes off Whatsapp, send a message to an old friend via Skype, you may get a reply in a couple of years when they possibly check their account. Oh, of course, its a Microsoft app, hence the lack of innovation and vision...	irrelevant information

Awful app. Constantly disconnecting, can't watch streams, awful connection, constant robot voice, won't load messages properly. Discord phone app is awful now. PC app is fine. New design is also awful, can't access message properly, can't even swipe to see members online in servers. The app is a hassle and chore to use. 2/5 only because PC app is great.	bug report

Perfect until they removed sms, now its unusable	bug report
Ever since the app had an UI update, I've never gotten on time notifications. My messages NEVER LOAD when I un tab and re tab back into it. If I want to see the latest messages, I have to keep reopening this darn app. It's pitiful that I have to be forced to use this low maintenance design of an interface... I'll decide to give back my 5 star review if we're able to switch between user interfaces that properly function.	bug report

Began adding lots of superficial features such as stickers and 'story time' that I find useless, and with the announcement that they'll be dropping SMS support I no longer see the point of Signal for the average user. Barely anyone in my contacts list uses the app so it's not worth keeping as an encrypted messenger. On exporting messages to a new app I chose to delete the SMS from Signal, leaving me with 3 'conversations' (one of which was Signal advertising new features). That says it all.	feature request

Don't waste time. The minute you get a text, you can't read it till you upgrade. Deleted, so STUPID. You came here to give a vague stupid answer to my review knowing that I won't be allowed to reply to it. No this has nothing to do with being verified. It happens right after the verification has completed the minute a text arrives. So those of you who don't like their times wasted, stay away for your own good	bug report

I used to have a great time with the mobile app, but recently there's been formatting issues where all of the popup bars for Server Settings or when you click on someone's profile is very thin and off-resolution. Not sure what the deal is but it makes a solid half of the app unusable.	bug report

Whats up with Signal doing away with the sms function for encryption only?!? The beauty of this app is that you have both encryption and can use the functionality of sms for those that dont have signal so I can use it as my main messaging app. Soon to lose the sms function is a big downer for the app in general. Listen to your users and don't get rid of the sms function!	feature request

Since the update I've had nothing but problems. I belong to two servers and they are intermingling with each other. I'm having to force the app to stop several times a day. Dislike the new layout, search function for something on a particular subject e.g searching on a word now seems to be null and void. Also not being able to see who's on line with a quick swipe of the screen is annoying and extremely time consuming. Please revert back to version before the update!	bug report

Always freezes sometimes don't get messages want work half the time and call quality is absolutely horrific.	bug report
The new swipe to reply update wasn't and never was needed in the first place and the fact it replaced a useful feature is just a huge step back.

This app is for real and i got it right the first time i installed a phone app on my tablet. Not only that, it works all the way across 2 tablets and a phone.

Or blowin up your phone 24/7 LOL. I'm sure some can relate atleast ! I reccomemd the 1.99 sim card. Not for ads, for # preservation. Ads dnt go away like said	irrelevant information
Every since the update it's been incredibly difficult to use the mobile app. The layout is unintuitive and difficult to navigate. You can't easily swipe to see who's online, and to search for anything you have to find it hidden behind multiple other buttons. Additionally, ever since the update, my app keeps crashing and when it's not, I'm having to manually reset it because it's displaying incorrectly or not showing what I've sent, resulting in me accidentally spamming.	bug report

I've used Signal for years and it's been great. I've been about to send end-to-end encrypted messages with a traditional SMS fallback for people not using the app. With their recent changes to Signal they're removing the ability to send standard SMS through their app, sighting that having any insecure messaging fallback isn't what they're focused on. The expectation is to get everyone on secure messages, that's just not feasible and neither is using two messenger apps. Extremely disappointed	feature request

This is such a scam. Twice so far I was charged and not provided with the service. Then I had to go and buy more credits. I know I continue to use the app. However, life is not fair.

Removing all sms capabilities, and does not allow you to export signal messages to other apps. And when exporting sms/mms messages, it messes up the process and corrupts group messages. Considering how this has ruined all of my conversations between my friends, I doubt this app is as secure and functional as it claims to be.	bug report
I actually don't mind the UI changes, but did you really have to break the mobile app to do so?

I'm not sure how this managed to happen but the chats have a tendency to break and lag. If I switch from one server to another, the previous server's messages will still show up no matter where I go.

Don't even get me started on the changes to usernames that's gonna be implemented eventually. The current username system is working perfectly fine.	bug report

Been using the app for a good few years now with no issue, but after recent updates, I can no longer switch between servers easily. I tried reinstalling and restarting to no avail. Kinda sucks after having used it for so long, I'm screwed out of using discord mobile to its fullest because of an issue like this.	bug report
Have been using this for a long time now and it was great in the beginning, but the recent updates have made Groupme buggy and slow. Trying to do too much perhaps? Group messages don't show up unless I manually refresh, keyboard input is laggy and responses are slow to show up. update its only gotten slower with every new version. why?	bug report
I recommend you use this app	irrelevant information
its an amazing app but it just has wayyy toooo many little updates on the app. Im on chrome and it takes a long time to update it. Please try to limit your updates unless its something big or some bug fixes.	feature request
Links get expired too quick which sometimes can be frustrating	feature request
Amazing chat service. Beautiful layout, simple and easy to understand, just the best thing ever. Edit: I edited from 5 to 2 stars with the new layout changes, it's hard to navigate, the new dark mode is hard on the eyes, it's not intuitive, really just pretty bad. Please let us go back if we choose to.	feature request

Skype is a great app for group video calls and meetings but sometimes when i try to talk by unmute my microphone someone mutes me and i don't know how is doing it. Which annoys me. I'm a student and my mic works properly in regular talks but while asking doubts or giving answers someone mutes me. I think only admin should be allowed to mute someone. And so i am rating this app 3 stars.	feature request
If it had audio chat it Would-be that much better	feature request
So I was entering my stuff and then I was done and it said the internet was not working I went to settings and it said the internet connection was  excellent so I recommend you not using this app if you read all the vote for Stuff	bug report
App used to be good. Lately getting a lot of trouble to make calls to landlines. It doesn't connect properly, either one end or the other can't hear each other.	bug report
Their cookie cutter reply coheresed me into rewording my review. This app is stone age trash. Get Google Voice. You get a 100% free lifetime local number (I've had the same number for over 5 years) the ability to place calls or txt via the GV app or on your PC. People you block get a recording telling them your number has been disconnected You can even call Canada or Mexico for free. There are so many options it makes these devs look like amateurs. And the best part, "ITS TOTALLY AD FREE!!!"	bug report
it's a great app I'd give it 5 stars but I feel like the calling can be a lil better it. I usually mess up often from losing signal and my wifi be fine.	feature request
This is an ok app. But I cannot use my nitro credits without having to spend money. It sucks. The new app is a bit glichy but all n all its ok.	feature request

I've been a pinger user for 5 years. The latest update with full screen ads after every text is TOO MUCH. Do you really think I will get excited about anything in that advertising when I'm in the middle of a conversation. Fix this! Or I am moving on with a new number somewhere else. UPDATE. Latest update disabled the back button on your phone so they can try and force the advertisement down your throat. Fastest way to exit is home button, clear recently used app and then relaunch. 0 stars	bug report

Great chat app. Better than most.	irrelevant information
Theyre getting rid of SMS support. So you either have to harass all of your contacts to try and join signal or just not be able to text over 90% of them. This will render the app useless for most people	feature request

This used to be the perfect all-in-one messaging app. When in late 2022 the Signal Foundation decided to remove standard SMS support, I was forced to find a new messaging app. This decision disappoints me, and I hope the Signal Foundation changes their mind. Updated down to two stars because Signal is wasting their labor on a "Stories" feature that I can't stand. If I wanted TikTok, I'd be on TikTok.	feature request

I've used Discord for years now and have never had problems with it till now. It'll kick me from calls at random and will mess up my mic audio for no reason. I guess I can't do any more sleep or long hour calls with friends anymore -_- I liked old Discord much better, it shouldn't have been changed	bug report
Good app. The only annoying part is when I make a call I have to disconnect from internet or go to setting a force stop app because the hang up button does not work.	bug report
Dropping my 5 star review because every update makes this app worse and worse. Please, please stop pushing updates when your app was already incredible and user friendly. Please bring back the option to see who is online on the server at a glance without navigating to a new page. Please bring back the button to pull pinned messages on the main DM page; replacing it with the 'call' button on DMs isn't worth it as voice activity is more for voice channels in servers.	feature request
Updates continue to worsen user experience. New UI requires more taps to do less and no longer mirrors desktop experience. It's harder to search, view pins, and use DM's alongside servers.	feature request
Does not save photos you send or receive	bug report
They many problems in voice	bug report
I COULDNT CALL ANY 1 NOR RECEIVE ANY CALLS WHILE USING THIS APP!!!! THEN THEY WANTED ME TO PAY $4.99. FOR WHAT I KNOW IT WASNT GOING TO IMPROVE IF I GOT A TASTE OF WHAT THE FREE APP DOES!!!!	bug report

the new update has made the app entirely unusable, not only does it have countless bugs and looks terrible. I can't even move channels via app anymore I HAVE to be desktop in order to moderate my own server. also the new "classic" look it has is just horrid I love desktop it looks good and is actually decent to use. the app is so buggy and hard to navigate. PLEASE bring back the last update instead of the horrible thing we are having to use now if you can even call it an update.	feature request
The old discord layout was considerably better and easier to use, the company's response to the change being "just get used to it" is also incredibly disappointing. This was an unnecessary change and if we don't tell them how we feel now they will continue to make changes we as the users don't agree with.	feature request

Had to down my rating from 5 to 2. Used signal for years without issue. Recently, numerous bugs have been introduced to the application. Group messaging is horrible now. Messages disappear, especially if I am the one starting the group chat. Most Apple users can't receive videos or animations when I try to send them. Had to switch back to default Samsung messaging. Currently, signal only works well when the other person also has signal. Was not like this in the past...	bug report

Random people keep texting. It's an odd app, but it works so no complaints	irrelevant information
Solid app have no performance issues and would reccomend the app to everyone I know that needs a local number or even a number period nowadays for the most part we are all on a WIFI network about 95% of the time anyways so really you can use this as your default number and skip paying a phone bill!! I'm seriously thinking about doing that myself so I can save my wife and I 55 bucks a month!!	irrelevant information
Does a good job of making secure messaging easy while being vetted by well known cryptographers. However, the decision to drop sms support makes messaging a whole lot less convenient and makes it much more likely I'll mess up and use the wrong app. Oh, and they messed up the export of messages - all my group chats include me as a participant so all the chat threads are broken	feature request

This most recent update with the change to attaching files/images, whatever is the last straw. Sick of these idiotic changes to the UI for seemingly no reason except to drive away the user base. Also, taking away the ability to give advice in-app about recent updates is just another slap in the face. Been riddled with bugs for years too. Only been continuing to use it because my friends do, but I'm ready to turn back to just texting or maybe messenger even. Don't download this.	bug report
Totally Legit!	irrelevant information

It only made selected phone call to not all like it's supposed to.	bug report
The reason why I gave it three stars is because I was trying to verify my phone number, but it wouldn't let me as it said an existing account is already using this number when I deleted the existing account.

Overall this service was better than other free texting and calling wifi services offered, however they decided to lock my account from services I've already been using unless I paid for them. They allow you to use verification for a little while, then suddenly require you to pay if you need to do any more verification pretty much locking you out of any accounts you verified on the phone number until you pay them. This is a problem with any service that used two-factor authentication. Slimy.	bug report

My internet is working perfectly fine, I even tried it on my other devices and it said the samething, at this point I'm just pissed off that i wasted my time.	bug report

Usually takes between 10 to 20 seconds just to open! Also the notifications disappear before you look at them	bug report
Please remove the payment feature and provide it as a separate app! I don't want any bloatware. Please also be aware that you fall under different laws now with this feature, which might backfire. I don't understand why you take on this big risk; End-to-end encryption is already not well seen by many governments and politicians and worth protecting.	feature request

Can you guys set up a feature where we can mute specific people in specific groups? I may not want to be notified if a person posts in one group because the information doesn't pertain to me, but in another group I do want to receive a notification if that same person posts because this information has relevance. Muting the whole group isn't ideal because then I am missing important messages.	feature request

Im giving it 2 stars because theres this bug that wont let me use the app at all, no matter what my wifi speeds are, it wont connect to the app, just stuck on "Connecting..", this is only on the mobile version	bug report
Absolutely terrible and a nightmare to use. The most glitchy app I've EVER had and can hardly type with all the adds and glitches. Never rings or even shows up when someone calls you. Will not let me send pictures and took tech support 2-3 months to finally fix my issue just for the issue to come back ina a week. Will be very relieved when I uninstall it and will NEVER download again.	bug report
good app so far. theres a lot of advertising until you purchase plan that stops the advertisements. still have it use for my personal private clients. no issues	irrelevant information
It baffles me how did they manage to develop an app that's so slow and in multiple occasions just none-responsive?	bug report
The Discord app used to be fast, functional, and consistent with their other platforms until recently when they decided that none of that mattered and it was far more important to become a copied and pasted "optimized mobile experience" with less functionality, a convoluted layout, and horrible performance. Gotta love when platforms randomly decide to set themselves on fire for no reason.	feature request
The app was great, but I think this last update wasn't really it. I don't know if this bug is from the current update, but I'm not receiving the app notifications, not even when I'm in a call. Please fix this! Besides that, Discord is a great app.	bug report
I have yet to find out how to be able to initiate a message. I couldn't find any instructions on how to use it. Evidently it's not for anyone who isn't already a "techy".	bug report

There is a problem with the sending of photos or videos, it's not going thro Could u mind fix that	bug report
I use it to communicate with my boss and my coworkers. The UI is fairly simple, and it's somewhat pleasant to look at in terms of aesthetic. Though it doesn't have any fancy or special features, it sets out to fulfill a single purpose, and it does so without issue. That's all I could really ask of it.	irrelevant information
I really love this app but the only thing that's been bothering me is the Role's design because it's a hassle when I manage and reorder the roles. When I reorder them, the other roles mix up with another and it's frustrating. In comparison to the old one, it's much more easier. It's a really great app but I would love to have the old version of the Server Roles back.	feature request
It's a good app!!!	irrelevant information
It's ok but sometimes loses video and sound even when both mobile devices are full bars	bug report
Best messaging app. But there is a problem occurred that sms sending slowly. A little bit slower than normal sending time.	bug report
it's alright but some people don't get my text messages it annoys me .	bug report
There are far too many ads, my calls get dropped even with full Wi-Fi signal, it lags horribly (it takes almost 1 minute to open the app which makes me miss calls), the voice lags with about 10 seconds of latency, and it doesn't always show notifications or ring. I guess you get what you pay for. If stuff gets fixed, I will make it 5 stars, but I don't see that happening.	bug report
Okay, need be much faster service	irrelevant information
It's not facebook... enough said	irrelevant information
The redesign fixed the problem of discord mobile being a scaled down desktop version, which I would argue was it's biggest selling point. Very disappointing...	feature request
Tho this app is perfect but im facing bugs in signing in my acc from another devices. It always shows "New login location detected". Discord developers need to fix this bug as soon as possible.	bug report
I am always in these groups that need to use groupme. Every time the app works great for the first month or so, then it stops sending texts without wifi, and now it won't send text with wifi or data. This has happened to me at least 3 times before, and it is obviously an internal issue that NEEDS TO BE FIXED.	bug report

What is the problem with repeating the functions of a desktop application?! Not only does the sound not work when there is an incoming call, only vibration, but also the interface is poor and stripped down. Some squares instead of the ability to select a video image of the opponent in widescreen 16:9 and 9:16 versions, so that you can see everything, and not the center of the camera. I'm talking about pop-up videos, both in the app and outside of it. Too poor mobile app :(	bug report

First off it doesn't let you send video at all and secondly no matter how good your Internet is it still either drop the call entirely or it makes it completely mute on your side so the other person can't hear you	bug report
After the update, video call has bug such as it didn't show my video call to the other person that i call with and its said 'unstable internet connection' which is weird because before the update things was going alright and my internet was not so slow.

Manages to have bugs on every single update. Given that 90% of updates add irrelevant paywalled features. One recent W was the voice messages feature, which is a rare thing to see. Great app to find communities for literally everything, but the updates seem to be actively working to make it worse.	feature request
Newest update keeps messing up my Bluetooth connection whilst on mobile this needs to be fixed ASAP	bug report
Skype has become very slow. Clicking on a button/menu takes up to 2 or 3 seconds. It's been like a year every version is slower than the previous one. Being myself a software developer, I feel there could be much more performance improvements.	bug report
Notifications are unreliable. Messages don't come through when they are sent.	bug report
VCs are very inconsistent and the app has many many crashes, especially while streaming or trying to multitask on your phone. It's not very mobile friendly, and it will cause your phone to spasm at times. Other than that, it's very clean looking and there's tons of features and I believe Nitro is around 75% fair- I feel like anything that makes the app's functionality better shouldn't be behind a paywall and Discord should do more to optimize multitasking for mobile users so it's true to ads.	bug report
It doesnt send my messages, i have to uninstall the app and re install and then it gives trouble to load for me to login..i can see myself on the vc camera for some reason also...plz fix these issues	bug report
Doesn't always ring when receiving calls. Not all app verification codes will deliver to it.	bug report

Dude.. remove the newest update immediately. It's HORRIBLE. I can't swipe to see who's online and overall harder to navigate. My advice to you all, don't get the app or if you do turn off auto-update before it's too late.	feature request
Its very beutyfull	irrelevant information
I need just one more thing here, or maybe 2. 1) I need an option to switch between accounts. If the option is available for PC, why not for a mobile phone? 2) I know it won't happen, but I need a bigger word limit. The current limit is not enough for me. I don't think it will ever be enough though. I just write really long messages. And even premium doesn't meet my needs. It's good that I can at least send it as txt file, but it's not the same.	feature request
Coming from discord, the actual call quality and connection is at least 10x better and more stable. My only complaint is the lack of audio settings. I cannot change my volume or mic volume, outside of using my phones volume up and down. I also cannot mute the other person's mic, only my own. Audio settings need to be implemented before getting close to a 5 star. *Edit Still no volume controls. Even with my phone volume at it's lowest, Skype is blasting	feature request
Skype Have Lot Of Bugs Please Fix That Bugs	bug report
If I'm using a phone number on the app why can't I recipe texts from apps I gave the number to get a verification code without reserving the phone number. And not just any text messages. Otherwise its a great app tho.	feature request
Three cuz it works sometimes a -5 because I was just involved in an emergency phone call and ads came up could not take the ads off they would not release the phone back to its normal functions and therefore I'm very angry with the situation now I'm not going to mention what exactly happens because it could be a legal matter I'm a little disappointed a lot disappointed.......	bug report

Last update issue # 1: A lot of time when scrolling up message in servers the moment someone is writting and sending a message it put you right back dawn the page. Issue#2 : A lot of the time leaving the app open to switch for an other and come back make discord screen reloading for 5sec and sometime back to message tabs when you where in a server.

Glitchy to all extremes - Opening chat notifs land you on your most recent chat - Huge load time for messages, feels like I'm in a different time frame from the rest of the group - name change/icon change doesn't stay permanent and reverts sometimes - overall extremely riddled with bugs and inconveniences Only reason I'm using this is for school. If you want a personal groupchat, there are hordes of other options that aren't nearly as buggy and inconsistent	bug report

What a NIGHTMARE APP! TEXT NOW will just CLAIM that you have violated there terms. Erase your call logs messages with no warning. There is NO one to talk to! It's just too bad.

I use discord regularly, its great for talking to friends and up until a week or so ago it even worked! The UI was great and easy to navigate but now not only is the UI worse, if you get a DM while in a server you have to go through 3 tabs to see it as opposed to one like before, but it's also barely functional. Half the time I enter a different channel it means I have to restart the app because it's bugged. Youd imagine discord would test a little more for things like this before pushing it out	bug report
App would work great if it stops messing with my volume control... I'm listen to music and when I jump on the app the volume turns down. All the time. Fix this issue and I'll by the monthly for it.	bug report

Removing SMS capabilities assures that no one on the fence can slowly transition to it by talking to the people that do have signal while retaining sms functionally and not fragmenting the "texting" into two apps. Good job telling the customers what they want under the guise of not "confusing users" as to whether or not a message is encrypted. Couldn't be clearer. Used it for all messages and it worked great. I hate to watch the developers kill the chance of mainstream adoption like this.	feature request
Not sure what going on but since about Monday or Tuesday this week for some reason people with AT&T and Cricket have been unable to get messages from me.

No annoying ads and reassuringly secure. The problem is I have to open signal to get new messages to come through. Not particularly helpful for work or family life. I used to donate money to Signal because it seemed like the answer i was looking for, but these problems are pretty fundamental flaws. I'm now considering deleting the app due to its inability to notify me of messages. People are now calling me instead which doesn't work for me either!	feature request
After most recent updates channels only open in read only half the time, do not switch and even stick between servers. Horrible and unusable.	bug report

This app works but really needs to improve its design & call quality. If I press things too quickly the app stops working, theres a lot of lag/delay, and the phone call quality is not great. You also can't send or receive gifs. At first I thought the service quality was due to it being through wifi, but the phone call quality on google hangouts was crystal clear so it's not that.	bug report

They could add lots of other features like reacting to comments not just liking them, which would make the app closer to other popular platforms. Also easier to add in gifs and other fun conversations pieces. You can use them still just not as easily as it should be.	feature request
Not worth it anymore, I've had this app for years and loved it. I was having a problem sending sms so i thought it needed and update.

Limited functionality; cannot delete, completly remove threads and conversations. You can archive only and then only one message at a time.

I like discord alot, I use it on my phone and computer, but the new mobile update has ruined it for me. I have to open and close the app atleast 5 times before it lets me messages my friends otherwise I'm stuck on my servers channel screen. And when I click on the message button at the bottom it doesn't do anything, but if I click on a server it opens. I can barely even talk to people anymore.	bug report
The app is great. The only things I would like to see change are the notification alerts when muted. I don't like seeing my name a notification even with my name tagged in the message if I set the chat to mute. The other thing is being able to delete messages and remove yourself from a group chat.	feature request

I've been using this app for a long while. Lately, it will dial someone I'm texting, then have no call screen or active call in the status bar to disconnect the call.

EXTREMELY frustrating!!	bug report

Removing SMS functionality means my quest for an independent unified messenger that allows me to do secure messaging -- when I need to -- continues. If I cared whether the telco tech got bored and read my messages, I wouldn't be using SMS. It's not like Signal ever left me confused about which I was using. Idealism beat pragmatism again, and something of value was lost.	feature request

Horrible. I used this app because I was not happy with paying so much money for more minutes so I downloaded this app thinking it was good and I could keep my original number. WRONG!

If you want a good free text/call app then I suggest using another app because I would not waste my time with this crappy one!	bug report
I never had a problem with discord, I love the app it's nice, but the new update sucks. I crash and lag alot when on the phone and it's mildly confusing.	feature request

I have been using this for a while now and find it pretty good for keeping small groups of people informed of the goings on. Sometimes, it's a little tedious scrolling through all of the info posted by the group.

Liked it, but no SMS support means I gotta uninstall. Not gonna juggle apps depending on who I text with. Also the constant begging for donations when the app starts is really annoying. One more thing, cant send video to people that dont have Signal - not even 3 sek clip. Really stupid decisionmaking, this app is gonna lose alot of users when the SMS-suppory drops. Gonna keep using app till then though, and change rating to 4 if decision to drop SMS is reverated and video to SMS comes back.	feature request

Works good,  perfect for group texts if someone does not have this app	irrelevant information
It's pretty good, but I'm having a massive problem with video. Anytime I'm on a call, if the person I'm calling turns on their camera it freezes every few seconds, and the only way to unfreeze it is to minimize the call and maximize it again. It's extremely frustrating and annoying, would be 5 star if video wasn't so broken.	bug report
I don't normally leave reviews but the new ui is a really nice change. I haven't seen a company make a positive change in a long time so it's very refreshing.	feature request

App does what it says and works exceptionally great if you want the WHOLE UNIVERSE CONSTANTLY calling you from before you get up until whenever. Worst aggravation EVER! Non-stop BS spam calls all day and if you get a locked-in number for your personal contacts it costs you to keep it. It automatically recharges your pymt account without getting approval from you first.	bug report
The app just isn't as good since they've merged all the versions. Long holds are very buggy, I can't even create a forum post on mobile, it bugs out every time. Edit: Another update, another regression. The app is barely usable at times now. Channels won't load, pictures are buggy. Very unpleasant. I love Discord but it's a shame that the Android app is in such a sorry state.	bug report
It's good it's what I want to have posted on my phone	irrelevant information
Doesn't work with my phone.	bug report
Ever Since the last update, the app prioritizes loading crisp clean ads over providing the services it advertises. I'm at a hotel and while I can watch a video in 480p without buffering, I cannot make a call using this app. in the time I'm waiting for the app to check my connection, it'll load 3-4 ads before telling me the my connection isn't good enough to call. As if their GREED didn't just suck up all the bandwidth in that single moment. Borderline scumbag design.	bug report

I'm on the same page with everyone else here. This new interface was entirely unnecessary. Nobody asked for it, nobody likes it, it's incredibly glitchy and not user friendly. Please pay attention to why your reviews so drastically plummeted. There's a good reason besides "stubborn users are failing to adjust." Take feedback, for pity's sake.	feature request
Ever since I downloaded this app I have been trying to get rid of malware and Trojans. Definitely not secure. I can't delete it. This app has destroyed my phone privacy and I severely regret ever trying it. Major security risk.	bug report

The new UI is horrible doesnt work, buggy and isn't interacting with the touch screen. The old app was much better and easier to use. I try to open the call and I cannot because the minimised square icon in the corner disappears and therefore I have to disconnected and reconnect for it to reappear. Please change it back to the old one.	bug report
Lately Skype has been super slow and glitchy, especially with the updates that have been released in the last few years. Many annoying and unnecessary changes as well, and now I can't even navigate my conversations or send messages without it freezing up and becoming unresponsive Also, it used to keep a memory of what I was doing, for quick multitasking, but now, if I open another app and then come back to Skype, it has to load everything all over again and it's not very good at all	bug report
Only used it once, but it gives you a phone number where you can choose where it is, as well as which available number (I rate 4 stars because it allowed me to send pictures of my deceased dog from my tablet to my phone)	irrelevant information

Terrible performance and reliability from this new ui. This is a classic case of style over contact. All glitz but poor function.	bug report
Worst app ever !!! Installed and signed up for an account that was how far I could get. The app failed to give me a phone number regardless many attempts with different area codes. Gave it another chance by reinstalling the app, it couldn't recognized my login I just created minutes ago. That's it for me, it seemes a bogus app, wonder where we're all the reviews came from.	bug report
Nice and clean! But shouldn't had changed the UI in my opinion, overall everything is working good and fine. Sometimes notifications doesn't pop up, so i think the devs should focus a little bit on that.	feature request
I like it but I wish you could change the color and set themes and things like that üòï	feature request
It's pretty good when you have a signal if not it'll drop calls if you try to go to an app or something else while you're in a call it will sometimes drop the call you can't go to your calendar or your calculator anything other than that it's great¬°3	bug report
Calls are always crystal clear!	irrelevant information
Don't use this, they ban your accounts for no reason. I made an account, didn't get passed the sign in page, then it says my account was banned. I made another one, texted someone "Yello" (testing to see if it worked), closed the app, went back on to text the person again, tried to log in, it said that account was banned. I didn't even have time to DO ANYTHING! I made that account today! The banning system is so bad, do not recommend.	bug report

All these recent negative reviews are true. Before this update, discord was great! This update has so many bugs. Texts come in later but you can see part of the new message in the friends list long before it loads in the actual chat. I often have to reset the app because it won't allow me to send a gif I want to send, the loading times for everything has increased, and many more bugs. This mobile app no longer has a user friendly UI. I have a new flagship phone, so my phone isn't the problem.	bug report

Hey, your app is great, really. But there is only one problem. I have some people which I remember their username and I don't remember the 4 numbers.

For over a month now, in voice chats, myself or others would be randomly disconnected without warning. No indication, still appearing in the call, but we'd be completely muted until we hang up and rejoin. I'm also no longer getting notifications despite none of my settings changing. This has only been happening for a day or two, thankfully. Loved the app but giving this a 1 star until both of these issues are resolved.	bug report
Newest ui update is awful. No one wanted this, multiple people asked for this change to not happen, and they still went through with it. Discord is becoming Teams at this rate and it makes me want to uninstall.	feature request

This is by far the worst app on the play store. God forbid you don't text someone every single day it will THREATEN to release your phone number. The day before I got the first message I used it to text my mom. The next day it says "your number will be released soon due to inactivity." They lost a customer. Don't fall for this fraudulent app. They make you pay like $1 a day to keep it but still. That adds up.	bug report

I've used this app for 4 years and it's a wonderful way to communicate, but the voice message option will NOT work!

I really enjoy being verbal, and I'm very frustrated at this. Please fix it.	bug report
I like it, esp that I can tell when text has been seen. Occasionally, I don't receive texts others have sent (signal & non signal).

Okay so I've had this app for a few years in the beginning 5 stars but in the last few months things got weird. They took the number and I got a new 1 but it doesn't work. No inbound or text the number just doesn't work, but I wasn't allowed to change me number but once every 30 days. So it has been a useless thing to me recently. It very disappointing. I would even pay for the service but scared the new number will not work. When it was working it was great love the hold music and all.	bug report

Go back to the 2017 interface and I'll give it five stars. it updated again, and its even worse now. The menu that pops up when i swipe right is useless to me. Give me the option to disable it.

I would love to be able to have full access of the sound settings and put it as I like. I noticed that the noise reduction is too annoying I would love to edit that.

I'm gonna have to change my review from last time. Whenever I open the app, the ui sometimes tends to not load and get squished in the middle, as someone said before. Sometimes, it happens twice, so I end up having to restart the app. There is also a problem with how you move roles or channels. It sometimes doesn't stick to where your finger is, so you're having to move your finger higher than it should be. Other than that, it's still a brilliant app to socialise and play games on.	bug report

This app is the worst with it's "oops looks like your out of minutes." What if you need to call your parents? What if your being kidnapped? If I could I would leave a 0 star but I can`t. Please fix this it is very annoying. Also it shouldn`t be called text free if you have to watch a video or pay for minutes. I can`t express how mad this app makes me. Please fix it.	bug report
Better... but now the app just lags and freezes my phone upon opening and closing.	bug report
Very bad,no call in app telegram please repair	bug report
Please For The Love of God change the UI back. Please. This looks disgusting. This app really is getting worse with every update. Why must you do this to us. Like if you need this UI so badly, at least give us back the old one in the settings. I'm fine if you're gonna stop working on it, I don't care, just give me the option to use the old UI. This change is so useless and unintuitive. Doesn't even look like Discord anymore. Please.	feature request
Is good up until they cut me off and made me start paying to use it so i think that was not good and sure not free so yup! But other then that up in l that it was really free and good so i think that is what I was went through and everyone n need is different so might as well try it to see?	irrelevant information

It keeps saying "connecting while my internet is good and it won't stop and i can't talk with friends i hope you can fix this issue because discord is not usable for me rn	bug report
In the past few months there have been major issues with messages going through. Not only it doesn't notify for new messages, sometimes messages don't come through for hours, including your own - i.e. you type something, push send, and it disappears. It seems to be somehow related to switching networks (wifi to data and vice versa or just to different wifi). Happens on multiple devices, too. Don't think it's my settings because it didn't use to happen previously and i haven't changed anything.	bug report
I love it is excellent	irrelevant information
Been using Discord since it released. They recently changed the UI again and this is by far the worst update in a long time. It looks and navigates awfully.	feature request

So. Many. Adds. Every time you send a message or click on somthing different, a new add is displayed. I understand that it'd a free service but the amount of adds totally kills it.	bug report
Contact information will not be updated. But it is updated on my contact list outside of the app, and the notification of my remaining balance every time I click or open a message is very disturbing on how much interference it causes with the interface.	bug report
called me not on slype, and it muted the skype call even after I hung up	bug report
Great for text messaging but calling seems unreliable. Frequent issues with establishing a voice call - then going straight to missed without a single ring. Happens over various devices, no matter what version, so possibly a systemic issue. Can this be fixed?	bug report
It keeps auto changing my numbers. How can I stop that... I've tried to contact the company but I can't reach. Now it's telling me account cannot be created on this device....	bug report
New update is terrible. Facebook Messenger look and function with tons of bugs-- feels like there's no reason to keep paying for my nitro if what I bought is now unusable :( Deleting this and finding an APK of older version.	bug report
Latest update is bad ui, and dropped performance.	bug report
Got used to the new layout, so it's fiiiine. But sometimes, the categories of servers are open and when I close them and reopen Discord another time, it's open again. I have them closed for a reason, so there isn't a large amount of channels on my screen, but it's really annoying when Discord keeps reopening them when I get back on. Can there be a fix to this, please? Then maybe it'll be a 5-Star	feature request
There is one glitch and it is in mobile when we want to react with emojis it becomes a straight bar pls fix it	bug report
Not receiving messages on my number	bug report
The new layout is pretty bad and makes it slower to navigate most areas of the app. Please roll back to the old layout.	feature request
Very glitchy with lots of requirements to work properly, which is even worse on mobile. 10/10 dont recommend, so pick another app than this.	bug report

Okay so, I had discord for awhile now and I wanted to make a new account so I did, I use my email address and I verify my email so yeah, but now it's telling me to use my phone number?

I really love Signal, and have for years... but the new decision to drop SMS support truly does change the value of this app for me. I didnt want to leave a 1 star, because it is still a great app and a great concept, but if I cant use it any longer, its lost a lot of value for me personally. I have been trying to make it work by using Signal and the default SMS app together, but its just not going to work for me. Im afraid I will end up uninstalling it.	feature request
This app is having serious issues. It's functioning so poorly. I don't hesitate to do updates, yet I've not enjoyed it for once. Just so unfortunate one has to stick with this!	bug report

temporarily unins the app due to storage issues on my phone, then they took away my phone number eventhough I am still paying this company monthly for ad elimination for a phone number they gave away in a short period to someone else, but is still taking my money out of my account, and won't explain how to link a new phone number to that dollar amount but they are still taking from me! For that reason, i don't recommend paying them or getting settled down with any particular phone number	bug report

This company is the worst that I have ever experienced. I paid for the service a few months ago. I haven't used the service much, just to get a message that I can no longer use the service and it has been canceled. When I inquire as to why it has been canceled, this company claims they cannot disclose such information and they cannot allow me to continue using the service. What rubbish! I asked agsin, "what is it that I have done to cause such a thing?" They cannot say.	bug report

It works well when it's online. Unfortunately there has been too many times where it fails to connect to Discord servers and can't even load or send chats as a result. Restarting the app is mandatory to fix it. Edit: I'm not having Installation issues. Every time I come back to the app it has a high chance of being stuck at "connecting." Happens on multiple android devices I have, regardless of ISP or connection.	bug report

I love discord. I've used it for several years now and have had an excellent experience before. but recently with the new ui update the app has gone downhill. it is basically unusable now and idk how to fix it.

I can only beg they go back to the old ui. there was nothing wrong with it so idk why they changed it	bug report

I've used discord since 2019 and have mostly loved my experience, but recently there have been a lot of major changes to the UI that are not optional.

Dropping sms support will be a bad move. They're taking away features! (and suddenly asking for donations every other time you open the app!?! What on earth are they thinking?) I got everyone in my family to get signal because that one app would handle sms AND encrypted chats AUTOMATICALLY. No need for parents/grandparents to make the choice of encrypted or unencrypted with every message they send. If non-tech savvy people have to make that choice, they'll use sms everytime.	feature request

TextNow is good to have when you don't have any service and you need to make a important call are text	irrelevant information
I like the premise this app is based on, but it's missing capabilities I used often in my previous messaging app. Making calls through the app is a cool feature as you can tell they are encrypted too. I don't know this as a certainty but the calls sound just like calls I've made on encrypted phones.	feature request
This app has been nothing but one issue after another. No I didn't bother with tech support because I never get anywhere with them. Its pretty sad you can't make or receive calls sitting right next to your internet router.	bug report
It's ok, but difficult to get to chat while on call, and difficult to end a call	bug report
This app was good to start but now I'm not getting my texts with a strong signal I can make a phone call or receive them. And I can't validate certain things with this number.	bug report

Used to be fantastic 5/5 starts. Now, it's just another messaging app since they've removed SMS support. I guess I'll have to move back to FB messenger and SMS and undo all the hard work of getting people moved over to e2e encrypted messaging. Oh well	feature request
Good concept, but not enough features to control how you receive messages, ie, SMS, email. Won't silence either üò´. Quite annoying receiving messages Every. Single. Time. someone joins the group or is added to the group üò¨ With some tweets this could be a great app. As it is currently, I'm definitely not a fan. üòê	feature request
This new update is absolutely the worst.. when I call people now it's only on half my screen, is all bugged out, and cannot be fixed. please stop making this app worse with each update.	bug report
Removed sms support and forced you to upgrade to a newer version so you can't keep using it for both. It is decent, but with alternitives that don't require a phone number or one's that still do but offer better functionality, all of which offer e2e encryption, there is no point in signal. Maybe they'll do something to right their ship, but they have a history of ignoring what users want and ask for in favor of "features" no one wants, so I don't hold out any hope, and neither should you.	bug report
I want to inter signal but they don't allow me why for my first time	feature request
This app is absolutely terrible. I can't even stay logged in. Just keeps kicking me out after 10 seconds of being logged in. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Waste of time and data and now they have access to my information for me not to even be able to use the app.	bug report
Since they announced the removal of SMS/MMS support I can no longer recommend this app. The removal of SMS also removes plausible deniability for people in countries with a repressive government. Signal will probably remain attractive for journalists and whistle blowers. My messages are nearly 100% SMS from medical offices, tradesmen and even banks. I also need to be able to respond with SMS. For me, keeping Signal on my phone is no longer worth it.	feature request

I truly wish this would be the world's messaging platform. It's secure, reliable, & has great features.

So that was the phone part . the texting, is kind of tentative, because it doesn't give you the time of the text.

These new updates aren't great while I think separating the DM and servers tabs was a solid idea having a slide to the right to reply function isn't helpful it's annoying I'm used to doing that to view members of the server for easy access in case I need to change roles or generally manage/view their status.	feature request

It was working fine til the new update. Now I can't open messages, it keeps closing the conversation. Please fix!	bug report
I've used Signal for years, almost from the very beginning. Over all that time it's been the best app for secure communication between those that also us it, AND as my default SMS messaging app. But with the announcement that they're removing SMS functionality, this app fails. Only one other person I talk to uses Signsl now. So rather than have multiple messaging apps, I'm just deleting Signal.	feature request
I like group me. Just wish it was easier to share pictures from other things with out getting a message that it wouldn't send. Other than that I enjoy it.	feature request
I like it a lot but it doesnt send pictures right away, i would give it 5 stars	feature request
Latest update has a lot of poor UI changes for no good reason. The app worked and looked perfectly fine before. I liked that the mobile version looked just like the desktop application, but now they're making it look like every other mobile messaging app. The higher contrast makes it difficult to read messages, and the new layout doesn't make anything easier to navigate.

Good texting app. As far as calls. It drops a little bit and it's not totally free. But great for business too.	feature request

its alright i guess? ive been using it since 2018 but recently my most important account got disabled(falsely), ive sent about 6 submissions and only got 2 answers via email but im being ignored and noone from discord support is replying, currently my account is still up, i just cant log into it because it says "your account is disabled".	bug report
Gave it a 3 because lately I'm having problems with it telling me if people are responding to me, I have not updated because I'm hearing horrible feedback. You need to fix it or I'm deleting it and I'll put in more complaints.	bug report

There is something wrong with the app. When I use the computer, everything is fine and works as it should. However, when I go to check the app, there are several messages that I have missed and it is really imperative that I do not miss these messages because they are sent to my wife overseas. I have reloaded the app. It appears to work for a few days, and then stops. Thank goodness for the web version! Is there a fix for this? Or will it only work correctly on the computer since the app broken?	bug report
Is good and easy to chat privacy but I hope the updating of it won't get worst but more cute	feature request
I have been using this app since 2017. But all of a sudden and tells me to get a new number. Without a warning notification. I loved this app it has always worked for me.

new UI design is bad why fix what isn't broken	feature request
Remove sms support? The ONLY reason i use signal is for its dual functionality. I certain don't need any social media bs on it. Remove sms, i remove signal, i don't need yet another messaging app to communicate with 3 people. Dev has seriously lost their way. Id pay for the app just to keep how it was early last year. Signal is quickly becoming irrelevant and is now deleted as sms support ended. Don't need separate app to.message like 3 people, what an idiotic thing to drop.	feature request

I'm sure your product team already knows this, but the day you stop supporting SMS is the day I stop using Signal. It's not practical to maintain two separate messaging apps for the less than 10% of shared contacts that also use Signal.	feature request

I have been on discord for a very long time, since 2018 and had so much accounts and i genuinely used to LOVE it but the new update is pissing me off, often crashes and a lot of times the buttons just wont work on press so i have to reset the app alot for them to work, also the appearance is weird and clunky and hard to understand and its not just a "thing that you will get used to" i hate it so much.	bug report
It is best of nest more than I can say !!! Thanks !!!	irrelevant information
This WAS a great messaging application until they abruptly removed SMS support. Yes I realise SMS is not secure but completly disabling it as means to communicate with people who arent on signal is not the solution. Switching back and forth between applications based on who im talking to is not something 99% of people are going to be willing to do.	feature request
It's great for texting. Horrible call expience so I give it 3 stars.	feature request

It has to be the app as I can send the same pics and gifs via text without any hesitation. Message notifications are spotty.	bug report
Love Discord, but the newest update made it impossible to call anyone. Edit: The devs replied to this saying to file a bug report, but considering how many other people are experiencing the same thing and other issues and likely have been reporting it, it's falling on deaf ears. Switch back to Skype, people. At least that site works.	bug report

A reasonable way to chat with friends and engage with online communities and finding others who share your interests.

So new problem! I dont like the new forced ui for multiple reasons but everyone is complaining about that. Today I am complaining about how nearly none of the icons or pictures are loading up cleared cache restarted it nothing it working. If not made it worst.

I've been using Discord for about 7 years at this point, I've always considered it a 5/5 app. However the new update is extremely user unfriendly, shoving a bunch of info into separate screens and doubling the time it takes to do anything, from checking PMs to simply looking at the online list for a server. The previous layout was seemlees and genius in its simplicity. The new one makes it a chore to use the app, and I hope the people in charge realize their mistake sooner than later.	feature request
Some disapointing differences between desktop and mobile and there's a lot of server crashes. Nitro is almost a must for the discord experience but it's pricy	feature request
Reverse the update already	feature request
Doesn't work probably.	bug report
Nice if law would not steal my info	irrelevant information
HORRIBLE APP I SWEAR I HAD 20 MINUTES ON MY PHONE AND WHEN I CALLED SOMEONE FOR 10 SECONDS I ONLY HAD 0 LEFT DO NOT GET THIS APP IT IS HORRIBLE!!!	bug report
I really like that this app is easy to use. You can silence the groups whenever you need to. I wish is was an easier way to go back to old messages without having to scroll back so far. Otherwise, very easy and simple way to communicate with groups of multiple people.	feature request
Why are you taking so much money off my card, 2x in Nov. and now 2x Dec. Stop the stealing üòÆ‚Äçüí®ü§¨	irrelevant information

Had it for a lil under a ur was working fine but know I cant even open the notification setting to set the notification I have to open the app to c if I have received a message.	bug report
great way to talk to a lot of people and keep in touch!	irrelevant information
The new interface is unintuitive, buggy and very, very slow. Selecting a server sometimes takes over a second for the app to respond, with no visual indication of whether it actually accepted your press (which is annoying, because the lag makes it sometimes ignores your press if you don't hold it long enough). Still two stars because it still allows you to send and receive messages once you've managed to reach your chat. Most of the time.	bug report
I really like discord, but for some reason is always bugging and not connecting when I restart the app. This is a serious issue that blocks me from using discord time and time again.	bug report
New update is not accessible. I hate the layout, I don't like how the servers and the messages are accessed from different pages. The video call layout is hard to navigate. There change in background colour makes things more difficult to read (yes it's still gray, but it's a different shade). Also I've found that video quality is much worse since the update. Videos are glitching and freezing so often that we can't see or hear each other, to the point of us looking for a different app. Change it!	feature request
Its cool for a group only for a short period of time.	irrelevant information
I would love to keep my phone number which is what I'm doing the butt there was saying is you can't call anyone on there they have to call you so if you download this game it's best for you to keep it because there's people that you were texting and calling and things like that and if you change it they won't know your phone number unless you tell them before you do it now another thing is if I could please just call my my friends and my girlfriend my mom my dad my uncle that would be great	feature request
I am extremely unimpressed. I've been using discord for years now. At least since 2020. Since the force discord update discord has been acting up so much it's making my phone and laptop overheat. Not only has the new layout completely messed with my muscle memory, it also hasn't been giving notifications or allowing me to report bug issues or call my friends. A bug issue I face quite a lot in the past few days is when I try to send a text, it won't send. Then sends 10 texts. Please fix this.	bug report
It is absolutely horrendous. when I try to change my password it always never works, It sometimes says; "It needs to be '6 or more characters" or "needs to be 72 characters below". There is also another problem when changing your pass, I made it a difficult password it says invalid token.	bug report
Other person does not hear unless they stay on for 2 min because you called them earlier on different phone to let them know your are calling to test the app	bug report
I am not able to get notifications of messages. I've checked all my settings and reinstalled app to no avail.	bug report

Amazing, I use it for most of my communication with friends. My only gripe with it at the current time being is that the ui isn't updated for S23+. Replies, editing, etc. Shows up as a squashed element, leaving a gray bar down the middle of my screen and no buttons to press.	feature request
Prevouis Message... I was able to locate the deleted message.. Thank you	irrelevant information
I love how this is a messaging app that's just a messaging app. No annoying social media hook trying to mine your data. I know it's for privacy, but I wish there was a way to back up to the cloud. And sometimes, the app takes a little too long to deliver a message, even when there are no network issues. But it's infrequent enough to not be a bother. Definitely the best messaging app out there. I love it.	feature request
Think this is the dam reason why....	bug report
didn't even work enough to sign up.	bug report
sometimes it's stops and network is busy	bug report
Disappointed that they are disabling SMS messaging since it works well as a messaging app. I will uninstall when SMS support goes away and go back to Samsung's messaging app. It's Signal's loss.	feature request
It terrible	bug report

I can't share my screen for some reason the screen goes black, nobody can see what I'm sharing. Can you please fix that. I have a Samsung S20 FE	bug report
I really do enjoy using this app. I suggested using this app for a company group chat to post scheduling and for updates on events going on at the place I work. It's made it easy to message coworkers I don't have numbers to and even my employer and coworkers have thanked me for suggesting it. It's simple and easy to use making it easier for the rest of us.	irrelevant information
Not worth it.	irrelevant information
It's OK, but not really comparable to the web interface. One feature that's glaringly missing is the "Inbox" feed of all unread messages.	feature request
If u r able to operate in UAE then we would love to get back to you guys. So please work on that.	irrelevant information
Disappointed by app behavior and privacy leak. I force stopped the app several times from the Skype app info... Yet it keeps overruling me and remain active in the background. If on an android device an app is Force Stopped, it suppose to stay remain closed and inactive until the user chooses to use/activate/wake the app again. I also have been contacted by a group I never shared my contact information with required to be able to contact me. Missing ability to report before blocking user/group.	bug report
new UI update is AWFUL. revert if you can and disable auto updates, slow as hell and more confusing for no reason. can't even search the full server anymore, you HAVE to search one thread at a time	feature request
Not sending picture messages anymore. It says that message is not going througg	bug report
It's fine but everytime I enter the app is always says "Set up TextNow to send and receive messages and calls" even though I gave it the permissions! It's ANNOYING!	bug report
Never gave out number but getting sales calls. I have received numerous calls from non-working numbers or numbers that don't accept incoming calls. I have texted one friend and called another since having this app. They are obviously selling your number to anyone and everyone.	bug report
Unreliable. Every update comes with new issues impacting very basic chat functionality.	bug report

1 star until you fix your last screw up The new interface is horrible. Not only you enforced the useless "swipe-to-reply" feature, but also removed the "swipe-to-see-members-list" feature along the way. How did this update even pass testing. Do you guys not let some users try it out beforehand? - An absolutely disapppointed 8-year discord user who buys nitro regularly.	feature request
This is totally not good...Soo many inominous calls and texts...It gets stuck every time i start chatting...Asking for soo many information when necessary..üëé	bug report
It has become very bad. Does not send codes	bug report
I'm pretty sure Signal unknowingly hired a deep state bad actor who is working tirelessly to ruin the app. Why can't I change the color of chats and keep mine gray or blue? Why do I have to chance the color of MY chat bubbles in every chat? Group chats are trashed now, and MMS is unreliable af. Please revert to the chat options from 3 years ago.	feature request
Sometimes it doesn't receive pictures. What do I do?	bug report
I'm very upset, I just had to reinstall the app so I could log in. It logged me out on its on and it deleted half of my messages(important) and calls.

Nice update but the problem is the buttons for the roles or to react isn't showing up	bug report
The newest UI update is terrible. We didn't ask for it. You didn't need to fix what wasn't broken. You have to shuffle through three menus to find what you are looking for. Even ruined dark mode. It doesn't sync with desktop anymore. I didn't want text to pop. You had a decent grey background that was fine, but that was is gone. Hopefully you didn't wreck voice chat with this "update"	feature request
The best app for peaceful chatting... can you make the app autosync with the desktop app when you connect to the desktop app? Some people trying to register can't get OTP via phone number.	feature request
Calls drop all the time you barley can have a decent conversation it gets frustrating because the other line can be talking and you hear them but they can't hear you. IF you don't have Wi-fi you might as well don't use the app because you might get heard or you might not long story short it's bad but good service cause the 2nd number but it's just difficult using because only wi-fi..	bug report
Discord just asked me for feedback, so this is exactly what they'll get. I just went through a bunch of reviews lambasting Discord's latest mobile UI changes, marking them as helpful. You should, too. This is because the latest changes Discord made to the mobile app have made it slower, more buggy, and significantly less navigable than ever before. In the past, I would have recommended it, but currently, I'd say skip it unless absolutely necessary.	bug report

Can't lie the recent update on android is awful, there's now a lack of seamless transition between direct messages and servers are very disjointed. No longer are you able to just swipe in and out of a DM, maybe this is on old devices but the transition animations seem to now be longer and more disruptive. Genuinely ruins the user's experience.	feature request
Works like a charm!	irrelevant information
This was a great app until it locked me out of my account and told me I needed to verify to get back in. It keeps saying it sent a verification email, but I haven't gotten one!

It's very good app. Connection has to be good or the app doesn't have clarity when speaking	bug report
Not sure this update was an improvement. I can no longer swipe to see the user list and I can't disable swipe to reply without enabling the launchpad feature. Messages don't load properly when you switch channels. I'd love an option to revert back to the previous UI. This just isn't cutting it. I'm only using my desktop version now. Update: Discord seems to be doubling down on the new UI, so I've canceled my Nitro sub until we we have the ability to toggle back to the old UI	feature request

Skype is a very cool app to make calls to any place of the World, very good support and it has very great subscriptions to call to too many places a very good prices, just I would like a subscriptions have included the text messages, because the rates to send texts messages is a little high and would must support MMS, not just SMS. I have a USA number and it works very well on device, like as phone, tablet or computer. I love to use Skype, really I'm a very happy user.	feature request
Between ALL of the texting apps out there, this was the only one that connected to my Google Voice. However your calls will get interrupted by ads, the calls will drop randomly, sometimes the person on the other line won't be able to hear you, ALSO you can't multitask while on the phone.

The new layout definitely brought people by surprise with most people hating it (myself included). After some time of getting used to it, it's whatever. The main issue I have is the status messages, which we can't see easily anymore.

New update made the app so unfunctional. The layout is very hard to understand, and lately the app has been glitching so many. Like everytime I open a DM it'll stay on that one persons DM page no matter where I click. Same thing the servers. It glitches out and I have to close the app and reopen it, and this happened multiple times. It also lags when sending messaging now for some reason? None of these things happened before.

Previously I said the new update wasn't good and gave a few reasons why since then I have encountered a dozen more bugs and glitches that and the horrible new ui make this by far the worst update I've ever seen discord try to roll out.

Good: I really appreciate the ability to set volume level for each person separately. Meh: I've had intermittent problems getting Discord to use my Bluetooth headset on my phone. These days it usually works if I connect the headset before I start Discord. Bad: in a video call with 3 friends, the app rarely shows all video feeds. Usually I see 1 video tile + 3 static tiles. And the video crops to a tile instead of scaling down; on vertical screen I only get a narrow slice of my friend's face.	feature request

Awful user interface update, it's clunky and gigantic, uses way too much space and just plain doesn't make sense in any context. Edit: The longer I use it, the worse it gets somehow. There's no muscle memory to be made, it's just awful, through and through.	feature request
WAY too many ads to the point you'll be in the middle sending a text and they will pop up and I have often accidentally downloaded apps because of it.

Your app is used by mainly Indian and Muslim men trying to scam innocent people. This app deserves to be removed altogether or find a way to remove the "Microsoft" scammers using your app. I got 5 phone calls from all different textnow numbers, all claiming to be from Microsoft.

So I see the signal not caring about our privacy üôÑ Like Whatsapp, Signal just ‚Äújumped the shark‚Äù and stops caring so much about privacy I had signal since 2017 I guess it's time to delete this app just like I did with whatsapp for not caring about people privacy	irrelevant information

Please put back the right slide to see the members of a server. Please swipe right to see the members of a server. Accessing logged-in members becomes too complicated, and complex too read. Moreover the private messages are not as important as the servers, the "home" button when you log on the page should be all the servers not the private messages.	feature request
Can be a bit confusing to set up but easy and good for techies: otherwise I would give it 5 stars. Brilliant at letting you hide the folders you don't want to use while out and about. Also lets you see an overview of new mail from several accounts in one window. Many thanks to all the volunteers who give their time to provide a truly free product. Much better than the browser-based systems used by Google, Yahoo etc that have so many intrusive adverts.	irrelevant information
Great alternative for texting... However, I have a SIM card from here... And I've recently noticed it's more buggy.. like how a few minutes ago I got a IMPORTANT message which now I'll NEVER GET TO READ because after the quick like 3 second display of the message cut off, I click the notif and it didn't show the message & neither did the app!

The mobile app cannot compare to desktop. While it has all of the features, it's not optimized as well.

Overall, decent	feature request

I initially sent a review back in 2018, stating the issue that the mobile app was too "bare bones" and lacked many features the PC version had. Now it's the opposite. This app tries too hard to copy the PC app 1:1 that its become bogged down and bloated with features that don't work properly on mobile. Most annoying being the laggy performance and the fact that server changes (such as channel names or users left) can take days, even over a week to update and show!	feature request

Betrayal! The old "bait and switch." Just when I thought I had found my one texting solution for all of my phone texting, you come out and tell me I'll need to get another texting solution to handle SMS texts!

Now I'm looking for a suitable replacement for Signal.	feature request
I swear these Devs haven't listened to the feedback for people with autism / neurodivergency. Removing the toggle to disable this change is unfair for accessibility. The black instead of grey (Dark setting) is horrible contrast for eyes, plus now it forces a swipe to reply which I have no use for and accidentally trigger. I don't need to see large activity icons of people I generally don't talk to. Things have been buggy, like search. Returning to a DM often loads it several messages up. Etc.	feature request

The base functionality works, which is the bare minimum you would expect from an app. That's why this isn't 1 star. The UI changes at random and for the worse, you can't do some things on mobile, and scaling occasionally breaks. All the while, Discord pushes their monetization onto us more and more aggressively. The most recent UI change is ridiculous and it's a sign of a serious failure that it made it to production.	bug report

With new version you can't perform searches within a conversation, they won't allow you to send files, only photos. On the top of that and as usual with Skype you keep missing conversations cos it won't send you notifications on time. Also you are not able to delete your call history.

They need to make it so that when a person is blocked they cannot interact with you. Discord enables stalkers, bullies, etc. It's a cesspool of toxicity and there is no way to regulate who you do and don't interact with. A social media site cannot exist without a "block" feature, but the one on Discord is very weak since it doesn't "really" block anyone. Seems they did just enough to meet the minimum requirements and that's it. Disabled and deleted account. Going to delete the app as well.	feature request
It's great for group text, especially to keep in touch with our kids sports teams. The one thing I don't like is not being able to erase old groups.

Since the big update, switching between channels often doesn't work. The app will just show you the title of the channel you selected, but the messages from the previous channel. I've also experienced attempts to back out of a channel instead leading to an outdated version of the same channel, with the last few minutes of messages missing.	bug report

The app is good, but it keeps crashing every 30 seconds.	bug report
No sense downloading off anything if it isn't gonna load. Am tired of random pop up ads etc not just text now. Who keep getting bullied etc. All apps are lies. Fakes etc	irrelevant information
I met someone who wants to communicate with this app... So I install it only to be told that my account is flagged for violation stuff. I never had one...my first time even hearing about the app. So I try to go through the appeal that's handily an option and can't because I can't answer any questions provided because I never had an account. Didn't make sense to me either...	feature request

Skype refuses my VISA card while charging for subscriptions. And every attempt to add additional MC or VISA card has failed with errors. So I unable to use it anymore. Great job. You've lost one more customer.	bug report
It works when I need it, thank you very much.	irrelevant information
This new update is trash. My emoticons are now translated into emojis. The font is even smaller than what it was, you added unnecessary stuff that wasn't needed. You're trying to make the mobile app look like a PC when it's a MOBILE APP. Why do I need to load messages? Scrolling up was just fine with me, and when I long press stuff, I don't get a buzz to let me know that I've long pressed it. Everything is switched around when it shouldn't be. Put it back. You're making it complicated for nuthin	feature request
My experience in this game its ok, but the game needs many improvements such as rss need it to build and research anything to expensive, time for building takes forever, developers needs to stop messing with heroes powers and troops is powers as well, castle protection is very poor we need better shields üõ° 3 day or more days if possible!!!!	feature request
Solid UI, quite responsive. The limitation to one phone per account is my only complaint.	feature request
old version was better. in the new version, it give some glitch and sometimes it crush	bug report
The new layout is super clunky and horrible. It makes everything incredibly complicated to use.	feature request
Good app, bit buggy, lags sometimes with bad connections, but overall a good app. Better then textnow for sure.	bug report
I open the app but they want $10 D	bug report
Its ok I think the only issue i have is sending pictures. Sometimes they don't get sent fully,it'll be cut off or cropped. Also sometimes I'm unable to send text messages it says unable to send to that number when I've messaged them before.	bug report
EnFlick and TextNow, are known identity thieves, who could care less about stealing, my phone number, I've reported them to several places, never use this, period, mostly sexual offenders, who can't own a cell phone and pedophiles, use this app, in my experience, and when the cops show up, they blamed me,...my identity has been reported several times,I've never used this App, nor do I ever intent too, garbage people use this.	irrelevant information
Discord before update was good, it wasn't an example of application performance optimization but easy to use and clear. Now that has changed. New Discord update delivered to us an new UI which I think is nice but terribly unintuitive. The UI takes some getting use to but I hope discord will fix sluggish application performance.	feature request
The app is real glitchy	bug report
I'd give it a 5 but I still haven't figured everything out yet. So far so great app though.	irrelevant information
Sloooow ! After you hit accept , it say registering for to long	bug report
The TextNow: Free calling with no paid features is about two stars in my opinion because the calls returned most arent valid for VOIP calls which tie the line. Maybe thats what the app even warns against but that just makes a call center have to call on settings above a standard rate I believe. Paid version: Havent tried this version but i dont think it would help me really..	bug report
Love the new update! I have been waiting for this, looking forward to other new updates!!!	irrelevant information

Worked fine/good before the hostile mobile update. It's hard to navigate and I've had nothing but problems since it was downloaded. Bug after Bug, issue after issue and it seems to have stemmed from this update since I have a very new and high quality phone. I don't get what happened.	bug report
I GIVE IT A 4 STAR BECAUSE IT SO HARD TO LOGIN	bug report
The biggest shortcoming is the necessity of a US phone number. The mobile apps are OK, web version is unintuitive. I switched to Discord for everything I was using groupme for and I am SO MUCH HAPPIER. Good luck groupme, you need it.	feature request
The app works as advertised. However, it is a battery and data hog.  Over 500mb of data in three weeks for texting only. And that's only when I am not on wifi which is most of the time. And after an hour or so if use I need to recharge my phone. I think you need to do something about that.	feature request
Good for a little but it glitched and tu don't get it text for like 12 hours	bug report
It's cute	irrelevant information
I use yo use this app all the time it actually has changed for the worse. More adds makes you watch videos for more minutes. I switched to textme which is truly free. You can text as much as you want and call as much as you want. Want a better app? Go there.	feature request
you cant delete old conversations that sucks	feature request
i was used to left swiping on a server to see the active members list but now it just replies to a text and tapping the channel header doesn't feel right to see the list. There are a few more issues like you guys have merged the activity window and online friends list, earlier it was much more easier to see who was online in a vertical scroll (with names) instead of horizontal scroll (with just their profile pictures now).	feature request

Skype generally runs well on my tablet with no arguments, how ever on my Samsung Galaxy s 8, I never receive any notifications unless someone calls me, and after 3 minutes of a video call my phone shuts off with a warning on screen (which I've never seen before ) simply saying the temperature is to high, this is the first app that turned my phone into a hot plate.	bug report

Its amazing overall BUT. Once i stoped the x button was frozen there (which caused it for that my bottem letters i couldnt press it ) and i had to deleted it reinstall it	bug report
Loved the app, but I heard the latest update made awful changes to the ui like the location of dms and a swipe to reply function as well as changing the search system. Put it back. We don't use discord for it to be like other apps. The search system was perfect. The swipe to reply is annoying and frustrating. Why would you do this? It sucks. Put it back.	feature request

Good way to send large group messages	irrelevant information
I have been happy with the app right up until the point they said they were going to discontinue SMS support. I don't have enough contacts that use signal to justify keeping it and using a second app just for SMS. Especially since the people I do know that use it will be discontinuing it as well.	feature request
I like this app very much. It's better than any other apps	irrelevant information
This app is pretty great, but recent updates have so many annoying pop up messages now, so lost a star. App does nothing to investigate hate speech. Lost another two stars.	feature request
The new UI genuinely makes discord harder to use. It comes with a tonne of new issues like the chat scrolling up 20 messages, so you have to scroll down every time you click off a dm.	feature request

It would be really great if your BLOCKING feature actually BLOCKED people. It's absolutely ridiculous to have a block that just "hides" the blocked person's server comments, and keeps them from trying to message or add you as a friend.

Therefore, there is no way to cancel the subscription and the support is terrible!!!!! The best I can hope for is to delete the app from my phone and hope the account just fades away!!!!!!!!

The app seems to work correctly for the most part part. It does miss notifications here and there but that might be the process getting killed in the background.

You need to pay to get verification codes:l. EDIT: don't act like it's for the users benefit.

Now I'm even more mad you replied like that. We know the numbers are temporary, that's the point.	bug report
This is the most amazing app. I bought my phone number to secure it. And for $4 I have free unlimited texting and calling. It's 2018 there is probably free wifi every block.

I'm happy with TextNow not until they offered a sim that they're claiming to be free but we have to pay $5.00. I paid for 1, it never came then I moved to a different city, again, I paid for another one and that transaction was on March, it's been 3 months now but no sim card was received.. my husband did the same thing, order , pay , and wait forever.. are you guys a scam?????!!!!	bug report
New UI is buggy as all get out. I try to switch between channels and servers and stay in the one I'm in constantly requiring an app restart which doesn't really solve the issue. Also, I don't need swipe left to reply, I do want swipe left to see who's online in my server.	bug report

Have been a big Signal fan and user for many years. Loved the ability to fall back on SMS if friends or family didn't want to use the app. Now with that functionality being removed, I have no use for it. Back to Google Messages I go, I guess.	feature request

It's a good app. I like how it runs and stuff, but my only problem with it is its very laggy when u opened it one night it froze my phone for 5 minutes then when I went back in it all my texts were gone. I wish it was less laggy, and that nitro was worth what I paid for. It's cool, but it's not worth what I paid for it	bug report
Overall good app for a group of chosen people. It does what it suppose to do. No real issues.	irrelevant information
All I can say for now is that I goofed and installed it on the wrong phone. Couldn't find an option to change phones or close my account. The best I can do is uninstall and start over with the other phone. Won't be able to give a proper review until after that.	bug report

This app is clunky and frustrating. I had to use the mobile version today while I repair my laptop. It was a nightmare. The layout is an unintuitive mess, I wanted to see the chat while we talked but I couldn't find it, is it an option? I don't know. If you rotate your phone the app loses its damn mind, becomes sluggish, things appear and disappear randomly. Honestly, pulling teeth out of my head would have been preferable.	bug report

COERCING people to use this more than they wish. Ie use it every few days or lose it.... feels like abuse. I use this app to help low income clients rebuild basic needs. Already lost one number.

So far I am not at all impressed with this app. I can't make calls because it drops them and it can take hours for a text to go through! Some times I don't get notified of any messages I might be getting ? It's a very üëç nice idea but so far it's not all that great !	bug report
I love this app ! It's clean, quick and beautiful ! And secure !!	irrelevant information
The new layout sucks. It's extremely unfriendly to users and runs even WORSE. Messages never send and it constantly takes you to a random point of messages you've already seen instead of the newest ones.	bug report
They Removed SMS. Nice app, but I can not convince all my friends to install this specific message app so back to pure SMS it is. I liked the app but it was the merging with SMS that gave it value to me.	feature request

When someone sends me a message from another messaging app and they have the Signal app installed, my reply goes to their Signal app, instead of the originating message app. Many people don't have Signal selected as a default app and if they also have notifications turned off, my replies are never seen, because they don't return to original sending app. This is extremely frustrating, and unfortunately people are not aware that Signal preferences Signal, rather than the originating messaging app.	feature request
Edit: I'm still being charged. I've tried to find the "cancel my subscription" it says it is in my account info. It's not there, I have found no way to cancel this App. Stop charging me for services I haven't used in a over a month. It's your fault if someone texts me. I do not respond to anyone. I don't use it I don't need it!....Just sent an email to cancel. I don't need it anymore as I now have my phone back on. I will write a review once I make sure it's canceled and ur not charging my card.	bug report
this app works pretty well, it's well thought out and it does provide a backup if your Wi-Fi signal is not strong enough.

Can I go back? -- UPDATE somehow it went back thank you so much. I've been a nitro subscriber for a hot moment, i will continue support. Ty	bug report
I love Discord, I really do, it's my main way of communicating with so many people in my life, but I absolutely cannot tolerate this new UI. There was nothing wrong with the old one, and the new hot bar at the bottom is painfully unintuitive. Before, I could just swipe to see all the information I needed at a glance, and navigating things like settings and my friends list and DMs was incredibly simple. I just want the old layout back. Maybe an Old Dogs setting or something? This is awful	feature request
This app was great for many years but in the past year they started sending me messages EVERY SINGLE DAY that says "uh oh, it looks like you haven't used your service in a while, be sure to send a message or make a call to avoid losing your number", even if I had used it in the past 24 hours. If you need a free number for a short time it's OK, otherwise you're in for a super clingy relationship with your phone to make sure you don't lose your number and that's even with purchasing the sim card.	bug report
Unfortunately, Signal has recently become one of my most hated apps. It's always been a great app for both iPhone and Android users, but in recently, it's gone downhill. My connection has consistently been awful, so I decided to reinstall the app. Unfortunately, even though I had two backup folders, when I tried to open them, signal some how managed to completely wipe them from my device. Now I have lost thousands of texts that I desperately want back, but there is no hope. I hate you signal.	bug report

When i first downloaded the app it worked exactly as advertised! I was very pleased. Now, however, im constantly receiving random calls and texts from unknown numbers. It is very annoying not to mention confusing! The app still works fine, once i maneuver around the fake calls/texts, which would have earned the app 4 out of 5 stars. However, if it's possible, id like to see a schedule message option, so i can type a text and set it to send at a specific date/time. Thank you for all the hard work	feature request
Froze up to often, to annoying for a simple conversation	bug report
I dont get why ads are allowed to block the keyboard for up to 15 seconds . . .	bug report
Incredibly buggy. Opening one server often shows a different server's content, and it is difficult or impossible to navigate away. The app must be restarted to view new content. Clearing the cache only briefly fixes this and other issues. This app keeps getting worse.	bug report
The one flaw that I see with this app is the sending of photos. I really enjoy being able to communicate with my friends and family, but sometimes I want to send a lot of pictures at once and I can't. Another flaw is that it doesn't notify me when a message comes in until I am in the app. Otherwise it's a good app.	feature request

These dummies don't understand plain English. You post a review describing the problem, they respond with useless reply. When trying to scroll up/down, app swipes left/right too easily. Frustrating to use.	bug report
New mobile layout sucks. Search functionality was changed for no reason, button placements were completely shuffled around to make the most commonly used things far more tedious to press, and other issues as well. Meanwhile, the perfectly serviceable semi-public design that was available beforehand was seemingly completely abandoned.	feature request
Clunky rubbish, which I continue to use. Excellent app from a privacy point of view, but can no longer be recommended as it will no longer be a drop in replacement for the SMS app. The development team is fixated on adding useless garbage such as stories and shitcoin payments. Also, the message backup feature is quite limited - you can only restore your messages on another Android. High risk of losing your message history.	feature request

Absolutely trash except for sending messages. Terrible for adding or deleting people or altering settings. But thank goodness we got new features such as dino emojis for likes now! Also, I use it for about 5 minutes per day and it uses a HUGE percentage of the battery compared to what it should.	bug report
Discord has always sorta been laggy on Android, but it has enough functions which made it easy to use. Since the last update, that's changed, and it has now become a mess trying to navigate through. Having to tap multiple menus to get up DMs, and switching back to servers, is a pain which feels overwhelming to me. Prior the the update, I could just swipe to other functions. I refuse to update the app until things are reverted, would not recommend atm.	feature request
Doesn't let you get verification codes without paying a monthly fee. That was the only reason I wanted this app for, to not deal with spam in my phone. Therefore I have no use for this, uninstalled instantly.	bug report

I rarely get notifications that my friends are trying to talk to me... and that makes me sad.	feature request
Less than perfect privacy model. When someone from my contacts first installs the app, I get a notification. It's nice, but occurred to me that someone might not want to announce to their friends that they're using the app. It would be nice if the default is to not notify others, with an option to do so later. There *is* an option for me to turn off notifications of when others use Signal, but no way to prevent the service from notifying others that I'm using it. Fix that, & it's a 5 star app.	feature request

I'm very disappointed by the december "update" for mobile. Breaking image sharing just to change up the view? Not worth it. It's less intuitive, still doesn't have the same neat features as desktop (like profile pic overlays), and is still glitchy whenever screen rotates. I don't understand why its so complicated; AIM did it a decade ago with no trouble. an update/fix isn't an update/fix if it breaks things that were working perfectly fine.	feature request

But, I do have one minor little bug right now, because well, here's the thing, whenever I go to try and change the voice thing over in VC chat, for some odd reason, it won't let me switch it over to audio, no matter how many times I try tapping on it! So, can you guys fix this for me, please?	bug report
App keeps crashing every time I launch it, and my phone is telling me that it is due to the app having a bug and to wait until the developer has an update to fix it. I love this app and use it every single day. Hope this gets resolved soon.	bug report
Keeps me in touch with a group that is important to me.	irrelevant information
Frequently difficult to connect a call, not always online, ready for a call but must be enter the app first to make or receive a call. But once connected the quality of call or video is good, although the stability of connection can be better. I trust the developer can make Skype better in the near future.	feature request
Anybody who thinks this is private is deluded. There are people selling child porn videos on there. They must be incredibly stupid. You don't have to be a genius to figure out that anybody from INTERPOL can join SIGNAL just like you and me and infiltrate all the groups. Which they do. I know that for a fact.	irrelevant information

The new Discord UI update is terrible. The mobile app has so many bugs. Not to mention, the possible privacy issue due to this update. The navigation of the app got significantly worse too. I don't understand why the people working at Discord thought this update was a good idea. It was perfectly fine before. Please change mobile Discord back to how it was before.	feature request
You're dropping sms support, and your going to lose so many users as a result, including me. I'll change my review if you take it back. You used to be great.

Very Bad. Wastage of time	irrelevant information
Needs to support *bold* and _italic_ notations in text chat. Otherwise, quite good. (4/5)	feature request
Great theme and UI. Terrible amount of ads. Too expensive to remove the ads or lock in your number. I think it should be free to keep your number for the first year and from there if you don't use it, it's released to the available numbers list. Ads should not appear after a phone call. It's also annoying with the 'x' to close the ads showing in multiple places and only one closes the ad, the others click the ad to open your browser and go to such website in the ad.	feature request
Recently the app was very sluggish and slow. Please fix this	bug report
the reason I've used this app is that the ui is different from all the other social media apps and the latest update has completely reworked the ui and it looks horrible and is near impossible to navigate please bring back the old ui for the mobile app	feature request

The last update where you guys completely messed up absolutely everything has left me disliking discord more than ever before. Just yesterday i was thinking how amazing and user friendly it is but after the update today it has been messing me up so bad im half tempted to uninstall. Why would you make it MORE difficult to swipe to see members list? Why would you change the way to use the search bar looking for past messages. The update changed visually how it looks, it looks worse now overall.	feature request

Somehow the more this app is updated, the more it regresses. The UI is clunky and unintuitive, menus are hidden within menus and it feels like there's little thought for the user experience. The app is so much slower in general, sending images can take well over a minute for seemingly no reason, and it begins to lag when you scroll through many messages. On a messaging app, sending messages is an aggravating experience! Please reconsider this change, and actually listen to your username for once	bug report
The choice to remove SMS makes this effectively useless	feature request

I like the app a lot though there are some features that should really be added. A way to press on someone's profile picture to get the full picture and some free options for pfp, banners and profile design (in general). Making everything pay to get is very boring and doesn't really encourage much if you won't allow any free options. Maybe free options could be like a small custom feature where you can create a simple backdrop with discords options.	feature request

Used to a 5 star app. But lately since the last two updates my texts will show up in the notification bar but when u go to open them they aren't there. It takes about half hour for them to finally show up. I also can't make it receive calls. If I call out it just ends and kicks me back. An incoming call with show but there is no way to answer it. The answer but is no longer there.	bug report

The updates are aggravating. I just had my account signed out and then have it tell me I don't have any contacts unless I sync it with all of social networking. Seriously? I don't want that much involvement.	bug report

When I started using the app it worked as designed. Since the last update when I try to place a call it rings once then hangs up. I have reinstalled it and aldo restarted my phone. Three stars because it did work at first but now it is not working.	bug report
Texting is good. Calls, on the other hand, get dropped or the other party can't hear you speaking, even with good/excellent 'quality'.	bug report

One star to the support, they never answer back. Poor	bug report
Dropping SMS support kills my use case for Signal. I don't want to use one app for txt msgs and Signal for everyone else on Signal. The 2nd star I'm knocking off is because the MMS Errors haven't been fixed in over a year, probably bcz it's dropping support for it. Good app, but you're making a mistake dropping SMS support. Tons of Android users will drop this and switch to Google Messages.	feature request
ok. could be better. sometimes crash.	bug report
would give a 5 star but recently when i click a photo so i can see it fully and zoom in more, it just goes black screen. now me and my friend have to send pictures one by one so i get to see them fully. if we send them by bulk and we click to view it fully it just doesnt show anything.	bug report

Notifications are broken. I thought it was my old phone but no, I have the latest Samsung and only Skype's Notifications are messed up. They either show up 4 hours late or don't show at all. Messaging and calling works fine but it's incredibly annoying that the notifications don't work.	bug report

Latest update layout is not good. I much prefer the layout that matches the desktop experience. At this point it seems like a vast majority of Discord users dislike the app redesign. The app is still functional but I find myself unable to get used to it when the desktop version and the mobile version were so much better when they were similar in layout. I can barely control my calls anymore and I have a hard time with my phone automatically using handset mode instead of defaulting to speaker.	feature request
I paid for TextNow plus that keep picking on me about minutes avoid losing my number but I still get harassing messages from them about spending more money	bug report
I've been paying for the Text Now app for about three consecutive years now for work purposes. It takes a long time for my messages to load, I'll delete the app restart my phone and redownload the app which I've already done today and it's still taking a very long time for my messages to load. Which is sad because like I said I pay for the app I think I'm going to go see if I can actually get like Bell or Rogers with the phone number that I'm using	bug report

Such a horrible app, I get my main discord account with all my friends overseas deleted all because of a joke I made in a discord server. Some kid asked for my age and my response was -7 in which is obviously not valid as an age and obviously a joke. Man discord you are such a DISSAPOINTMENT and you disgust me	bug report
I've been using this app for around 2 years and it has been a good way to communicate with friends, but what I pretty much don't like is the new update thing, it's not really all that bad, it's just the photo thing, otherwise I enjoy it.	feature request

I've tried giving this app chance after chance over the past few years and it's garbage. Hijacks and interrupts with ads. Doesn't connect calls most of the time.

Typically I have no major problems with Discord (It crashes while in voice channels often but isn't a huge concern for me although annoying) but now I can't cancel my Nitro subscription and it has already charged me early despite my attempts to cancel the subscription. I attempted to write a support ticket but was told I was unauthorized to view the support page. This is on top of losing an account because Discord crashed every time I attempted to enter a security code. These need to be fixed.	bug report

The app was great until the newest UI update. Now there is lag/delays on pressing buttons and switching screens. Sometimes it won't even let me enter text unless I stop the app and restart it.

Never used it thought it was im my mobile..auto update lol	irrelevant information
Its great but not the best that i have tried	irrelevant information
this may be the worst ui change in the history of social media. not only did they break the entire ui, they did the worst job of trying to put everything back. everything has been relocated to the most out of place areas, searching now has to go to an entire seperate tab and can only be done in one chat, chats no longer have an easy add button and now have to be manually added through settings. so many more small and inconsistent changes litter this update, not to mention the random slowness.	feature request

This is a fair program.  The texting works great, no noticeable lag. Phone calls are another story even with a consistent connection.  Quality isn't very good. The ads are annoying.  I would pay for an ad free version of the program. If you honestly have that much free time to try and earn "free minutes", get a job and pay the .99 cents..	feature request
The app is decent but somehow it manages to knock out my devices WiFi signal and disrupts Bluetooth in various ways at the most random times. Can't prove it but I know it only happens when discord is active.	bug report

They don't just show you ads no they bomb you with ads and force you to see it. I gave 2 stars because it gives you an extra number. Voice quality is good. ** After the response of the developer: First, I didn't ask for ads free. You can have ads but in a better and less invasive way. You guys have full page ads and even when I called my self with my other phone, one phone was ringing (rang 3 times) and the other was showing ads without ringing. Second, the app does not deserve $10/month.	bug report
Lots of bugs over the past 6 months	bug report
Whenever I screen share on my phone, no audio can be heard through the stream, and when I attempt to cancel nitro, the app sent me to the subscription tab on google play with no way to end subscription there	bug report
After a while of getting used to the new UI, it's been alright. My only issue is that it sometimes to often crashes randomly, when I type something my keyboard would start glitching, popping up and down for a few seconds, it's annoying. Sending messages is still abit difficult, it's like it prevents you to send something in a quick speed, typing it is still abit slow. New bug I've currently encountered is sometimes when I reply to someone, it won't show the "turn ping off/on"	bug report
The automatic detection for the user actually speaking doesn't always work, instead constantly sending audio... I DO like that if I'm listening to something on the device, WITH A HEADSET it sends the music audio... That certainly helps with gaming, just not literally helps. There are a lot of apps that try to be a discord alternative but they all suck. What would people rather do, use a phone call to everyone playing...? No.	bug report
I love this app!! Especially for people like me who have NOTHING! I'm homeless and can't afford to pay for a phone every month. If it wasn't for this great app, I wouldn't be in contact with ANYONE! And I been trying for 2 years to get a place 2 live. I need a phone for that	irrelevant information

Sometimes calls and texts are delayed as late as by 1 hr. This app would delay text but it shows as sent and received on the senders end. Calls just don't go through and shows as a missed call way later on the receivers phone. I would only use the app if what I needed to say or text isn't time sensitive.	bug report

I've used this app for many years (nearly a decade) and have always loved that it allowed for a single "one stop shop" for all messages. Despite what Signal devs seem to think now, I never had any trouble understanding which message threads were or were not encrypted... This move to stop SMS support is not necessary, nor is it wanted (clearly -- just look at how many have said this exact same thing). Unfortunately, I too, even after nearly a decade, will apparently be deleting this app soon.	feature request
A lot like WhatsApp. Has a few features that are better than WA and some that aren't as good.	irrelevant information
Well, it is an okayish app since the recent update, there's too much lag to connect my recent chats although im on wifi connection, and the notifications also seems to disappear and no more missed calls/vidcalls notification, sure there's a bugs somewhere, gotta love it if it fixed in the next updates.	bug report
The app is good, but the new update really made everything even more confusing. Which i dont like.	feature request
Removal of SMS cleaved my contacts list since most are too old to get used to a new messaging app, and flipping between them is really tedious so far. The three people I have on signal are also debating just leaving it at this point so that we aren't all stuck like this. Quite a shame as I liked the app very much.	feature request

Texting is great. However, calling is an issue. Every call I make has an echo on receivers' end, and when call is good, it gets dropped! I can't afford to keep adding minutes and calls keep getting dropped. Lately, calls are still dropped, breaking up or there's nothing ...like a muted call. Not to mention that when helicopters are landing at the hospital, I get the conversations!	bug report

Blocks incoming messages unless you pay. Useless app.	bug report
I would rate TextNow a 3.8 of it was possible. It's one of, if not, the best free calling/texting apps I've tried. My two major issues with the app are the large quantity of ads and the speed at which the app operates(which can be a snails pace alot of times). However I could pay a small monthly fee to rid the app of all it's ads. So other than the few complaints the features of the app are amazing. Especially being able to sync your service carriers messages and contacts seamlessly to the app.	feature request

I don't know why but when I try to send a message, it keeps saying "pending" or "sending," even though I can call and have a good connection. This lasted very long time. To get rid of it, I uninstall skype to keep fixing the problem. This happens rarely to me about the problem and the other thing is, it keeps logging me out when I was talking to someone in a call or in a text/typing.

Developers, please blink twice if Elon Musk secretly bought Discord, made it worse, and kept you hostage.	irrelevant information
The discord web application is great and the mobile app *used* to be pretty good but has since become far less usable after the UI update. The app is slow to load and will often "stick" to specific channels that it loads even when trying to select different servers or channels. The changes to things like the search functionality and DM location have also been detrimental to user experience.	bug report

The registration is failing over and over again, hope it will be fixed soon	bug report
Not sure why this is labelled as a "texting and calling app" considering the fact that calls won't notify you and will just immediately go to "missed call" unless you're in the app itself 24/7 (but that'd be ridiculous), and on top of that, 98% of the time your call will make it so the other person can't hear your audio after a minute or two has passed. Use this app for texting and nothing else, since calling is literally impossible to use properly without it bugging out or breaking completely.	bug report

Hey guys looks like you basically bricked my phone. I write code in Google docs, and I was explaining some to a friend on discord.

I've been using this app for a few years now and it's always had its problems but this latest update has broken it.

I love using Discord, I use it every day for messaging and voice calling my friend because it has been the most convenient app to do so on. However, the new updates revamped UI has only added new bugs and difficulty of use. The app constantly crashes or won't load without a restart; marking notifications as read, well, it's a 50/50 chance that even works; though to do that you'd have to get your notifications.

I am a teacher, and this is the perfect way to communicate with a group of students without giving out your phone number and using text messages. It worked perfectly for a retreat we run with a team of adults and student leaders, both for planning meetings before the retreat and communicating at the event itself. I can't recommend highly enough for leaders of school groups!	irrelevant information

My opinion on this app is that it gets the job done and my score of it reflects that (3/5 stars), it doesn't feel intuitive and doesn't do anything spectacular.	irrelevant information
On my old phone, loading images from the gallery sometimes took ages, that was my only gripe with the app. On my new phone and apart from that gripe it's really amazing, better than WhatsApp in image quality and very ergonomic to use, plus of course the big security benefit.	feature request
Downloaded the app on my phone and it was great. Easy to connect and use. Synced the app to my PS5 and Sony Account and ever since have had a world of issues. Generally comes down to not being able to be heard but can hear everyone else in the lobby. Not sure where the disconnect has happened but hope it can be resolved soon.	bug report
Was my default messaging app for years but with SMS support going away I'm not going to bother with it. Barely anyone I know uses Signal and most people don't bother switching messaging apps. It's nice when others use it to take advantage of the encryption but I'm not going to bother keeping track of who to text on what app.	irrelevant information
intrusive ads	irrelevant information
Very good and I can talk with somebody without having any other things happening	irrelevant information
This app over all is amazing. I would give it a five. The problem is that even though I have the notification s turned on, it is not alerting me, and I am not able to see very important messages till days later.	bug report
My experience with Signal over the years has been generally quite positive. It has seamlessly managed plain unencrypted messaging with encrypted messaging and it has always been obvious to me which one is which. For this reason it has been a no-brainer to set Signal as my default messaging app on any Android device I happen to be using. The decision to stop supporting unencrypted messaging though means that it won't be my default messaging app anymore. Which means I won't be using it as much...	irrelevant information
3 stars for good texting quality. Could gave it 4 stars if u could send pics, and could give it 5 stars if you could send video but 3 is all I'm giving it	irrelevant information

Terrible, so confusing. Doesn't work when you're trying to join groups or just locks you out of the app.	bug report
Didn't like the set up at first with this new update but I got used to it until I switched to super dark mode and it basically mixed up both the new and old layout, which made it hella confusing. I can't hardly call anyone as none of the in-call setting buttons will actually let you click on them half the time. And I certainly can't video chat any of my friends. They can see my feed, but I can't see theirs at all no matter what we try. We even checked phone permissions too, and they were on!!	bug report
Excellent call Quality...only needs optimal light for night call and text section adjustment. It dosn't show online and offline time. It should must be added.	feature request

Worked okayish for months, suddenly it's incapable of sending videos of any length which was really the only reason I used it to begin with. No amount of troubleshooting on my end has helped, so as of right now this app is pretty much useless	bug report
Glad text is free but calling isn't. needs calling minutes which is stupid when you said it was free to call any number. Can't hear my boyfriends voice now.	bug report
Worst thing is you don't even know we have been blocked on signal as it is showing double ticks. It should deliver msg as a single, if we are blocked so that atleast we stop messing the other person other wise ok Plz update any new features .	bug report

I find your description on google play dishonest! I signed up to get a telegram account but NOW I find I have to sign up for the subscription to get a verification SMS.	bug report
The mobile interface changes are horrifically bad. Navigating from one channel to another is now a laborious (and often impossible task), the display repeatedly shows me a user's profile I blocked weeks ago when I boot the application, and attempting to join a call on mobile is a singly futile endeavor, as you'll never be able to hear what anyone else is saying. If you haven't started using it, don't. Find an old .apk to install with, as the developers have stated that they won't go back.	bug report

It automatically logs me in and forces you to pick a number but I already have one. I can't even see what the login is before it goes straight to select a number. Can't stop it from auto logic. Tried clearing the cache, data, force stop and then I uninstalled TN and restarted and shut off my phone and still it goes to select a number. Its an endless loop. Text now works on my pc but not my Samsung A32. Tried logout of all devices from my pc but it doesn't log my cell out.	bug report

I've been a Skype user for many years but I really don't like this new version. It has too many unnecessary features. It keeps on lagging and crashing. It slows down my phone. I hope you can make a simpler version like what Facebook did. Something like Skype Lite or whatever you want to call it. As long as it only has the basic features, that would be better. I hope you can give users like me an option.	feature request
Add pop ups are terrible with this app how can you block add for free so isn't so slow.	bug report
Slow with chat history, wasting a lot of resources when loading it. And now it has a UI bug in the main screen, the first conversation is overlapped by the header where it specifies my account/search bar.	bug report

This app is poorly designed. If you upload an image it constantly fails no matter if im on a mobile network or wi-fi. Same goes for videos. The notif for the img/vid not posting is stuck until you delete the app. For some group chats im always sent back to messages several months prior so i have to scroll an eternity just to get to the current. Notifications sometimes dont pop up but when i open the app they all appear at once. The app compresses videos heavily if they are over 1mb. Bad app	bug report

It's crazy that you guys thought people would like the new UI, it's not even a matter of getting used to it, this is so horrible inconvenient to use that every time I get frustrated with the stupid swiping features I genuinely wonder why I still use the mobile app. I keep trying tk be optimistic and hoping you'll change it back, but every day I wake up disappointed. Why won't you just listen to your users and fix the issues that NEED fixing? Did you want us to have MORE issues? Bruh.	feature request

I love everything about this app, the easy quick messaging, the way you could mute just one channel in a server. The only problem I have is that I can't send most videos bc they're too large.

They only remove features to add useless bloat.

Horrible layout, forced on users without any feedback prior. The new layout is stupidly buggy even for discord, no one asked for it; no one wanted it. There's no way to opt out. It takes 5 taps to do something that used to take one tap/swipe. Many features are now just gone or broken on mobile. Maybe they could focus on fixing 5+ year old bugs, or better yet, hire better staff with that $500M they made last year to actually deal with the pedo problems? Nah. Gotta rake in that money. Shameful.	feature request
Discord just unuseable now. Deleting app. This fkig restarted app dev, needs bullets, or to retire. & it THIS IS everytime discord does an update release too. EVERYTIME. If they would've spent even 3 seconds to check this update, these updates wouldn't ever be out	bug report

from the look of multiple reviews of chromebook owners, its a sad shame to note, most developers work at cross platform use (leaving out chrome OS entirely,not even decent pwa functionality) perhaps someone at dischord is reviewing the reviews and aware of the platform inadequacies ,aiming to solve them asap.. before I experience them too ,somehow doubt that much though.	irrelevant information

Not only is the new UI absolutely ugly to look at, it actually functions worse than the previous one. Previously it was easier to switch from DMs to Servers because they were all contained in the same general area. Now, to go from a DM to a Server takes significantly more time to do. Not to mention how badly changing everything messes with the user's muscle memory. If you haven't had the misfortune of updating yet, don't.	feature request
I love the app but it does not have facetime then i would give 5 stars	feature request
Buggy? Doesn't describe how bad it is. When receiving a call that requires a number push on keypad it doesn't work.

For the longest time I've been the biggest supporter of signal but unfortunately no more. They have decided that the attempt for a prefect product will remove one of the best selling points for their application.

Now they are just another generic encrypted messaging app unable to be told apart from whatsapp, telegram, and countless others	feature request

It gets the job done but I'm sure there are better apps out there. 9/10 whenever I get a new message I'll see the notification for the message but when I click on it the message won't show up in the message thread, and the only way to solve this is to clear my cache and data EVERY SINGLE TIME a message gets lost. So that part eats up a lot of time and enthusiasm for keeping up a conversation.	bug report

Bare bone app that struggles to load messages consistently	bug report
The new UI is terrible, before the update to the UI was made, the app was simple and easy to navigate. An example of this is if you wanted to see who is active on a server, all you had to do was swipe right, now if you swiped right, it's a way to reply to a previous message, something that could be done by tapping and holding said message, so in this case, the new UI took away a feature and added a completely redundant one. There are more cases similar to this, but I'm out of room to type.	feature request

This app really is great and does the job, but that's when I can get it to work. I didn't want to update but was forced to, and like many others, I'm having problems since then. The new format stinks and you never know if you have a new text or not.	bug report
Wrost app ever.. messages not delivered on time.	bug report
New update moved everything around and greatly upped the contrast, making looking at it unpleasant to the point of being painful.

Was really used to the design of the app and now its bad. I don't like the new app design and I find everything annoying now. Especially when going into the channel, you can't see if someone pm you.

I canceled this app still being charged for it..	bug report
The app is really good but this recent update is kinda annoying, before the servers didn't used to show up directly when we opened the app but now it does and it's really problematic. I really hope you'll look into it. The rest of the features are fine but please just make the servers not appear directly once we open the app.	bug report

Absolutely annoying. The app is updated and always is.

The app crashes more than it works properly or it lags, hard to finish loading upon opening it.	bug report

since I only use this app once in a great while I tend to lose my number and there is a bug in the app where upon losing your number and opening the app it will say you lost your number and to pick a new one but the problem is that it just keeps looping over and over and never allows you to pick a new one nor does it give you the chance to even start typing in any number to find a new number to use because it will display that message stating whoops you lost your number right away.	bug report
Too many ads and glitching hanging up on people	bug report
This app is good and all but there way to much ads your already making money of the 4.99 a year to keep your phone number thing when I first open the app ad when click the call button ad when I'm on the calling screen ad when I hang up ad and then when I make social accounts I need to verify my number and instead of getting the code I get sent "to see your verification code you must lock in your phone number" it's annoying When people call me it doesnt even show me for that 2 stars	bug report

Dropping support for sms is a bad decision as it forces users to use multiple apps instead of consolidating. It's a big part of the reason I chose signal to begin with.	feature request
Good basic talk and text network that works without the requiring wifi or data. It is the only option that offers this for free with ads. Three stars due to the subscription data plans with talk and text only appearing on Android and not on iphone. According to the order page, the basic and talk and text subscription is an optional monthly plan (free is still the service) but no data. You will have to cancel to switch to the higher plans.	feature request

I love Discord, but the recent UI update is not great. Removing the intuitive swiping interactions to bring up menus (like the list of users on a server, for example), and re-arranging elements differently than what the desktop app has is clunky. Some of the other recent updates, like the activities in voice channels, are great but this recent UI change is a turnoff for the app.	feature request
Too glitchy. Like it overall but so sick of connection errors	bug report
I love using this App and that's why I'm giving it this 3-star review with a hope of improvement. Pls fix the camera recording within Signal (Samsung, Android 14) to standard lens or give us an option to select. It defaults to wide angle and is unusable in 90% of cases. Llistening to recorded audio is sometimes super buggy esp. when switching to other chats. It would also help to remember where I left for longer tracks. Lastly, why can't I filter between pics/vids/gifs in media search?	feature request

It is okay overall, but most of the things provided or advertised are with a paywall. You DO get a free number, however you DONT get it forever.

Used signal as default messenger app for 5 years. Highly disappointed that the creator plans to depreciate the product by removing support for regular SMS.

Incredibly disappointed that signal is dropping SMS fallback and really implore them to reconsider this. For myself and many others, the appeal of signal is that it works as a "one stop shop" the way iMessage does on iPhones. When SMS fallback is stopped, I will likely discontinue to use signal as it will just mean further splintering where I contact different people from and I have no use for that. Everything else about the app is great, which is why I really don't want to stop using it...	feature request

Got to work this morning with about 20 missed messages. The only reason I'm not going down to 1 star is because they have SMS. This is a basic, simple, approachable alternative to group SMS texting. And if that's all you need, it works great. If you need additional features for managing a team, you'll want to look for another app like Slack.	feature request

I've never felt the need to write a review until now, but I wrote out a lengthy one and realized I can't paste it here due to the 500 character limit. Is there an email or somewhere to send feedback?

Faultless. Why would you even use Whatsapp!	irrelevant information
Its good that the app finally added video uploads as i usually want to share videos to my friends but was not able to do so. Still it would have been nice for it to be more than 30 seconds. I only use this app because it was the only app to use for groups b3fore whatsapp came out and my.friends dont want to use whatsapp(wich is,better for me). Overall good job.	feature request
Its best one but i have given 4 stars because i wasnt able to chat to someone and i dont know about others.....	bug report

Besides that I am very happy with this app and I wish I could give 5 stars.	bug report
Actually one thing that is trash is new vc system especially in server because it doesn't let me disconnect screen share mute because it is not in the front it is in the middle and the vc interface is too big it doesn't fit in my screen and when I scroll to the right side it open the text chat of voice channels this big interface just only fits in PC one more thing about seeing profiles when I click on someone's dp it shows like this D I s c o r d # 0 0 0 A b o u t m E Completely trash glitch*	bug report

I've had this app for over a month.ANYONE I text doesn't get my text. I've tried emailing support twice, of course, to no avail. No company response. I've double verified numbers, unnecessarily.

Not free and horrible experience	irrelevant information
This app is great. As someone who's been using it since 2019, the changes have been great and I love it. I talk to my significant other and friends on discord all the time, one of the best and easiest texting and calling apps I've used by far. But one of the newest features has been breaking for me: the voice messages. Whenever I want to send one it won't send, I release and it continues to record. I need to close the app for it to stop and send if i press the send button. Very annoying.	bug report
Fantastic app. Much nicer than my default messaging app with the fantastic bonus of full security. Couldn't be happier.	irrelevant information

This was my default messaging app for the last couple years, and it worked great! However with Signal ending SMS service it just doesn't make sense to use it anymore. I just don't have enough Signal-using contacts to make multiple messaging apps worth it. I have many contacts who would not be willing to move (and it's a harder sell now than it was before), and I won't be able to receive automated messages anymore either. I'd gladly come back if SMS service was restored but for now it's goodbye.	feature request

Used to be a die-hard fan, but recently and especially after the mobile redesign I have just found usability plummeting. The formatting of the app is visually messed up if I open the app from a notification instead of the apps list and recently nothing will load unless I force stop the app from settings and reopen. Devastating to see what was my safe haven from other social media seem to prioritize paid cosmetics over actually listening to feedback and making the app functional and accessible.	feature request
I don't really care much about aesthetic UI changes so I won't speak to those, but they've made navigating between servers and DMs a pain, the layout is less clear, it's harder to quickly parse where new messages are coming from, you can't easily look at server members and navigating your DMs/search is buggy and jumps to the wrong places often. Extremely disappointed with this poorly-conceived set of changes and lack of response to the feedback.	bug report
It always says connecting even though my network was just fine. It's been so buggy, please fix this!	bug report
It's so good except for 1 thing and that is the NSFW servers that have explicit pic and n*dea and adult vids	irrelevant information
I'm one of the users that have used discord for years, the only problems I'm having are the fact the video chat doesn't stay open outside of the app anymore and the video freezes, no it's not a connection issue I go to different places with different wifi and it's still the same, why discord? I shouldn't have to stay in the app to continue video calling anyone. I've also noticed that discord also ends a call without warning or indication and that has led to alot of fights between people	bug report
Garage. Can't send a single message cause it keeps changing numbers on me and telling me my number is inactive (signed up TODAY) and assigned to someone else.

Text free works on my phone and iPod 6 just fine.	irrelevant information
Fine. Sometimes. A good social app, but recently it's going down the drain a bit. All the aggressive hate of the new layout update, and they still have the audacity to take away the button to disable it. Nitro features are nice, as sometimes typing can be hard for someone who doesn't like to talk sometimes, and are generally fun extras to have for decorating a server profile. I'd give it 2 ¬Ω if I could, but that's not an option. It'd be nice to PICK the layout version, very nice.	feature request

Dropping my review to two stars. The new Mobile UI is absolutely abysmal. I've been paying for nitro for essentially 7 years, and this was the last straw. Cancelled until such a time that the old UI is back *permanently* Breaking established design parity with Desktop is the worst decision that could be made. App is otherwise decent, and still functions.	feature request

Deceptive Ad free pricing, when you click the banner to go ad free a list of benefits pops up and the price is shown at 9.95/month, a reasonable price in my opinion, so when I went to sign up I was shocked when the Google play store said I would be charged 9.95/week plus tax so a little over $40 per month. Perhaps I read the initial offer incorrectly? No, the app shows 9.95/month if you click the banner ad but shows 9.95/week if you click to buy ad free from the app menu. Sneaky BS.	bug report

Signal users for security reasons know SMS is insecure, those who do not care are the only ones who do not know. BAD decision. Signal is now knackered. I appeal to developers... Retain the SMS capability.6th	feature request
Discord has improved quite a bit over the years. Everything works really well, the only thing I dislike is the main screen when you first boot the app. The home screen isn't intuitive and is kind of clunky. you can only switch between existing servers or add new ones and there isn't an actual home screen. It's hard to identify which servers are which until you memorize the emblems for each one. I wish it had a large home screen where you aren't forced to have a server open.	feature request
Can't even make a decent phone call the connectivity is horrible even on wifi. My work group just switch over to this saying it's more secure than whatsapp probably so but the quality is way poorer than whatsapp	bug report

Bro this app was amazing, Loved it minor bugs that needed fixing but design and convenience was really nice... Then we got the dumbest update I've ever seen, the bubly theme is somewhat nice looking, But the app is extremely inconvenient to use now, a lot more steps to do something basic like seeing people online in your server and other nonsense I got no space to type... This new version of the app is frustrating and absolute garbage.	feature request
Good app, but there is a problem with me trying to send images to other people. It always gets stuck and be on queued and the after that it suddenly glitches my album in every single app including Discord itself. Pls fix this	bug report

Buggy UI, calls that don't work sometimes, audio quality issues caused by calling. Would be a useful service if it wasn't so janky.	bug report
Discord has been a great communication app but lately I have this problem during voice chat. The mic work seamlessly in the app but once discord is in the background, it will not detect my mic. It has never occurred before. I've tried all troubleshooting methods but to no avail. I hope Discord team can reach out to me for this.	bug report
The app itself is really easy to use! I haven't had any problems, the texting is just as easy, I will use the call feature also!	irrelevant information

Please, for the love of god use anything other than discord. They say they care about protecting your data, that is a lie. Every promise made by this app is a lie to get more people to buy nitro to keep their investors happy. Discord is not made for people anymore, it is made to make money. The UI change isn't even the first anti consumer change they've made, it's just the most obvious.	feature request
It works sometimes really fast in others it takes all day like wth	bug report
I don't even get notifications in the app when my name is tagged. Can't see all of the tags for everyone on any servers but a couple random ones. I made sure my personal tag and everyone tags are on and still don't get it.	bug report

New UI is horrible. Makes it harder to mod/manage a server. Getting to the user list is not one hand friendly. Getting to the settings takes more steps as well as changing online status. Please revert back to the old UI and remove swipe to reply. Or at least give us the option to switch back to the old UI. And give us the option to disable swipe to reply...	feature request
They removed my review a sec after posting! Msgs don't go thru on same 5g wifi 10ft away. Ads cover screen while call is ringing makes it impossible to end calls/trouble for wrong # dials. Speaker is ON loud during calls even tho speaker set to OFF. It only rings after 4th ring on 'excellent quality' results in voicemail. Requires mic access, suspect. Major data use in background, odd. I suspect reviews are paid for this. Ads shud not pop up while a call is ringing.	bug report

So like the app, but theres 2 problems. I can't delete any of my group chats and now im receiving spam with nude girls in my chat room as a group chat.

I love this app personally ,but there's to much ads and when I click off of the call button and I'm still on ,if I click off of something the call pauses ,and I can't talk anymore ,but I guess it's because it's a free app.Anyways if you want to use this app I definitely recommend bc it's free!	feature request

As far as security goes, this is, to my knowledge, the single best app on the market. There's just one glaring issue for me, which is unfortunately a pretty big problem: I can only send/receive messages to/from other Signal users when I connect to the internet. This phone is almost never connected to the internet, so this bug is effectively crippling my use of the app to contact and interact with new friends. Fix this - make it work without internet, as it used to - and Signal is perfect.	feature request

This app came from a 5 star in 2015 to a negative 5 star now. Sometimes I don't get any notifications and sometimes I do. And at random moments my ENTIRE chat conversations are deleted and I can't get some important info thats been texted to me. This app is now trash and so inconvenient. TextFree is so much better with unlimited calls and text without having to watch stupid ads. This app is garbage.	bug report
The app enables people to do quite a bit together online, from voice chat, to online games, Discord is an above and beyond platform for gaming, or just staying in-touch with friends or family. It could be more user friendly. I find there are a lot of options, settings, and things you can do on the app in general. I wish there was a better home screen, with things layed out in one, more convenient location. Otherwise, I enjoy using this app with people in my life!	feature request
Super slow recently. Ghosting as you type and extremely slow loading conversations. Have to type real slow or the keyboard can't keep up, but keyboard works fine on system and any other app. Acts like app is low on memory and can't keep up. Resource intensive. Please fix. Used to work great. Also stupid icon that shows during loading seems to slow stuff down.	bug report
In the last two years, discords changes to the android mobile app have made the experience worse. Increased crashes and load times. However, the new UI overhaul completely takes the cake with how cluttered and not user friendly it is. It makes the app experience significantly worse, and I will only use discord until a better alternative is created.	feature request
I changed my ipod into a samsung tablet. So I regot this app on there, but for some reason on the apple this app you can change the background, colors, etc and make it look cool. While on my samsung its plain and boring. I hope you can change this.   It also blocks every picture sent to me and says low connection when i do have connection. Also my messages keep getting delayed because supposedly my wifi is low. Please fix this issue.	bug report
Works OK, but no longer as secure as it used to be.	bug report
The new update is awful, especially with the bugs. I have dark mode on my phone and have always had it this way; the same goes for discord mobile, always had it on dark mode. But now I have to choose between the two because of a bug where some of the text is highlighted in white, while the text is also white/grayish. It makes it so difficult to read, and following that.. it changes some of the darker role colors for no reason to a lighter color?? I don't enjoy this at all.	bug report
I just installed this yesterday and received my first calls today. The first time I could hear the caller but she couldn't hear me. The second time it disconnected us right away.

For a texting app textfree is an okay wifi app, choosing your own # is a definite plus, however the calls leave alot to be desired, even in full wifi mode your calls get dropped,  only other issue is every update requires more internal data usage then im happy with, im comparing other text sites because of this now and finding others use less data n are just as good if not better	bug report

Having only one app to receive all text messages was golden. Signal should recognize when the app is not installed and allow users to deactivate and unlink with the phone.

The value of this was having messaging centralized. This is my sms app. That also enabled people to be converted, if I wanted more secure options with them. Now, they're removing sms. That means that all my texting will be unable to go through signal. I'm not splitting my time between two sms platforms, just because one is secured. This is a very bad move. I'm not using 2 things, and require sms because many people don't have signal, so my messaging will just be insecure, now. Change your mind.	feature request
Would give 5 stars if you could talk on it but the only thing you can do is text	feature request

This is the most Secure üîê messaging app I have ever used but I have 2 problems :-: 1st). Not many people use Signal because they just don't know about it so I'm kinda stuck with WhatsApp. 2nd). I don't know how to back up my chats on Signal since I don't find a backup option where I can use my Google Drive to backup my chats by using my email address. I recently format my smartphone & I lost all my chats, so please make the backup chats option simple & easy.	feature request

What in the world is the Dev team thinking removing SMS support?! The whole reason to use the app is to consolidate encrypted conversations with SMS. Its a real shame that longtime users like myself and many others will have to find another option to do something that should be very simple. The Dev team needs to seriously reconsider their direction here. I hope for viable forks.	feature request

So why is Skype just giving up??? With other apps on the rise like ZOOM I think Microsoft drastically needs to shift gears and focus on salvaging there 8 billion dollar investment before its to late...

I love Discord so this hurts I've been using Discord since 2017 and have always loved it but with the new changes everything is going downhill. The new UI is terrible but what's even worse is the Discord Team blatantly ignoring our pleas to revert the changes. It hurts my heart to see an app I've loved so dearly be ruined for no apparent reason. I hope the users will show their displeasure by unsubscribing from Nitro and continuing to be vocal about these issues until Discord finally wakes up.	feature request
The new update is so poorly optimized it barely works on fold phones and the old UI is way better...why change things just for the sake of changing...sigh	bug report
One long ongoing feed for everything. I don't like having to scroll through a lot of messages to find content. Take a photo of anything you want to find later or forget it.

Overall, it's OK, but there's still no actual 'block' feature that has been requested by users for years. The blocked person can still read messages and continue to troll and/or harass people. There needs to be a real block feature like Twitter has. Someone gets blocked; I can't see their messages and they can't see mine. The report feature does virtually nothing as well. Until then, the app gets a low rating.	feature request
The app used to be very stable but now a simple notification with a picture in it can crash my phone so badly that I have to restart it. The management of medias is very clunky, half of my gallery pictures are displayed in the photo picker. I tried clearing the cache/data and reinstalling the app but no success. I guess its the price to pay for not running the latest Android. Its becoming tough to promote Signal to friends and family when your personal experience is getting worse :(	bug report

So i upgraded the app because it had problems loading. It is still the same thing. In order for it to work i would have to turn of my phone and it will go away. Now even if i do that, its the same problem. Even worse because i see the loading pop up after 15 minutes or so whenever i have to turn off my phone. Also sometimes i get the messages super late and i know it has nothing to do with the internet connection. Now that gets me mad.

Hi Developers! I don't know if you will reply this or not but can you bring back the old Text Free app? The one you used to call Textfree EX. I miss that one. I still have it on my old iPod touch 5th gen. Notice its no longer in any of the app store. I was lucky to have never uninstall it and I am still able to text on it and receive text to but it lags big time but the point is now I'm on android. I know there basically kinda the same thing but the difference was the Textfee EX had a setting option where you could change your main screen wallpaper and your conversation wallpaper background. If you can't bring back that old app, can you at least add that old feature to this new Text free app? If so Thank you!	feature request

Since latest update, if I share from another app new chats don't show in list until I open them. Needs a way to select all messages in a conversation.

The app is good. I appreciate the use of banner ads rather than commercials. It's probably a four-star app, except that every time someone texts, my phone lets out an ear-piercing, bloodcurdling scream of a notification.

It does not use the default system notification; I can't even adjust the volume down.	bug report

It hasn't been that many years since using most any other texting app seemed wanton and irresponsible to me, but some of them came around, and stole some of the thunder. That's a victory in its own way, but having to use some other app for the other 98.5% of my contacts... There's not much point to using this one like there used to be. There's just no downside, either. I won't tell you to install and use this (anymore), but I doubt I'll uninstall it.	irrelevant information

It's not as junky as other calling apps but I am not pleased with it. It drops calls for no reason, says "call rejected" if you make too many calls in a day, and it won't hang up! I can hit the button 10 times and it still shows the time going like I am still in a call, but the other person already hung up. They REALLY need to fix this stuff!

The new interface for the app is dogshit and unusable. None of the controls are intuitive. Get it together Discord, don't change what ain't broke.	feature request
Its wack, imo don't give people the control to change your name, your name is yours, not theirs. Its a whole complication when we ourselves should be able 2 change our names not ask permission to someone else to change it for you. It takes a long time, and for them to mess up twice is huge waste of time. Now its me, and why do IIII have a problem with it.

Changing from a 2 to a 1, I've now read the article Discord keeps posting in response to 1-star reviews. In brief it explains the (obvious) goals of this redesign and works as a pretty open statement that they do not care that they failed to accomplish these goals and are not interested in any feedback whatsoever on their redesign. "If you don't like that the app is worse now, you just don't 'get it'" seems to be the response. No, I get what you tried and failed to do, it just sucks.	bug report

I can't even send an image without the gallery crashing the app, or the image taking so long to upload I give up on it. Chats take forever to load, and the new UI clearly was made to look similar to other apps, whilst not considering if that's what should be done. It's so unintuitive now, cause discord isn't a generic messaging app, and the person who decided to redesign it to look as such should think about why people loved discord. Hint: cause it's not like all the other ones.	bug report

It's a pain navigating, why do you want to re-invent the wheel? it was already fine. Now it's broken.	bug report
It works okay for texting. Phone calls not so much. Perhaps it's my wifi connection but it's always cutting in and out. Also it has the tendency to drop calls. I see there is an update. I didn't download it due to someone saying it is full of ads making it basically impossible to use phone calls. I will take their word for it.	bug report

Dev team took the wrong road by removing sms. They could have warned and provided tips to help people in their security.

Some problems still always exist like being unable to end a call after you initiate it, echoing in some calls, with a perfectly strong signal you still can't make a solid call or even send a text,  watching videos or doing the tasks to get minutes doesn't always load them, if your call is only for 1 second you lose a full minute, the app is sometimes down for no apparent reason; these are the problems that always existed with this app over the years yet to be fixed, but 3/5 b/c it's the best app of its kind	bug report

Works fine, well laid out for mobile. However be weary my fellow foldable phone fans. The app really does not like resizing. On my Fold 5, if I use it on my cover screen and open the phone to th wider display, the aspect ratio will still match the cover displays ratio and will only take up one half of the main screen. A force close and reopen will be required to get the app to change. This also happens inversely. Going from main to cover screen will keep the aspect ratio and make it too wide.	bug report

Don't trip potato chip!! Not sure if it's my tablet or TextNow but sometimes I think my TextNow App is being tampered with. So using TextNow is a coin toss. Service can be great or service can be a two star service. My advise is when you allow TextNow affiliates to manage your service like texting and phone calls, know they might not be as experienced in management as you think. Be careful but not perinoid. Listening to someone else calls isn't violating privacy if given permission to do so.	irrelevant information

Well, I take back the positive 5 star . This app used to let me send photo and video. Not anymore. "Message not sent please try again " is what it indicates when I try to send a pic or video. And no the file is not large so that is not the problem. I've tried everything indicated to try and resolve the issue with no avail. TextNow customer service recommendations did not help at all. Calls and text without sending pics or video does work. That's why now I'm giving a one star rating .	bug report

Great app, been using it for some time. There's going to be some new changes soon. Signal gonna no longer send messages outside of signal. I understand the point of it.

Dropping support for SMS is an own goal that will significantly cut into Signal's user base. I have loved Signal for years and recommended it to many people, but will be using and recommending it a lot less now. Most people care about security but not at the expense of having to use two separate messaging apps. There are significant security costs associated with having SMS on the platform, but appealing to security purists at the cost of usability for most users isn't the wise move.	feature request
The new update where you can't slide left to see the people whos active in the server shouldn't have been made. Swiping left to repy to messages isn't helpful or easy to use for regular mobile discord users.

I have subscription for many years. Unfortunately by Skype side it was canceled. Because my payment did not go through (first time since I have this subscription). And exactly that time it was review of our agreement. So my subscription was automatically canceled. But was nothing wrong with my payment, and I think Skype want to get more money, because I contacted with customer service and they offered to get new subscription. But I need my subscription back.	bug report

discord is one such The thing was until its new update came, this new update interface is very rotten, we have gone to the option to talk to friends, where we could talk to friends in that option, now we have to go to the notification to talk, this option is a lot of torture.

Overall pretty satisfied. A couple qualms and hopefully constructive criticisms: at times I do not receive sent text messages, namely from numbers/contacts that require me to receive a code via phone so that I can input for verification purposes; ie online banking login. Also, I do not receive sent shared locations from contacts; I can receive shared photos (albeit somewhat blurry) and YouTube links that open as supposed to but when friends send their location I do not receive. Thank you very much and hope you take what I have written into consideration.	feature request

Nice features, but lacks UI and notification consistency. Chat media store is among the worst, not loading all pictures and videos from a conversation and taking a long time when it does. You also cannot send voice recordings on the PC version. Audio/video quality is OK, but it does not take advantage of fast networks although HD calls have been promoted for a decade. Skype does not allow you to use it in split-screen mode with another app which is a big drawback for me.	feature request

New updates kinda blow	feature request
Non stop updates available for the PC version. And now the mobile version pesters you every time it opens with a donation request. Also, there are all kinds of dropped call, not ringing, answered call but still ringing weird stuff happening with signal. If you think signal is private, just remember: Google allows it on the play store. That means it MUST have a back door for them or the feds to access. You're only getting the illusion of privacy. Big tech always has their probes up ur @$$.	bug report
The new ui is so annoying and so unfamiliar,please discord fix this to the old one if you want to make your app better	feature request
Generally I love signal. One big issue - Disappointed that it has trouble receiving/downloading messages from iPhones in group texts. They often just show up as errors and can't be downloaded. Not recommended for people that do a lot of group texting with iPhones.	bug report

They make you pay. Greedy company deserves to fail	irrelevant information
I would make it 5 stars but you cannot receive verification codes without buying the unlimited option and sometimes for no reason you can get banned for like 24 hours because it says you "violated the terms of use" the calling quality is bad sometimes you cannot hear what the other person is saying and if you try to send a video it can't be too long fsr and that's really stupid.	bug report
Had this for about 5 months now and I opted in for the sim card. I even paid to have fast internet and was still good. So I was reduced to 2G which was fine as long I can still use my phone for work. So while using my phone saw a message but didn't get a chance to fully read it cause my phone stopped working all together. Wasn't until I connected to wifi and saw that I was suspended for using too much data Like what? No where did I read I'll be suspended for too much data not happy about this.	bug report
Not at all what i expected. Which was more like a Telegram or even Whatsapp alternative. What i see in Signal is merely a crude barbones messaging app for sending only text messages. No file sharing capabilities to speak of whatsoever which is precisely why i use and need Telegram. May very well be solid for sms and text but i already have a stock texting app which works perfectly fine. May keep it for end to end encrypted texting but that's it. Certainly not a telegram replacement.	irrelevant information

Works great besides the user interface being a bit wonky	bug report
Because they said on the theme that it has like, delete it all myself and have to delete it and download it back. So that's why I do not like it, and they really need to fix it. And I like multiple numbers and lake locked in number and for them. And I hate when it does that, because it's like so stupid, like, why did they even make that up like I just saved a moth, cool, do that. But yeah, that's how I feel about it.should be more like objects on instead of a house, that's just how I feel how is	bug report
they need to revamp the app for phone to phone optimization thats the reason some calls go silent where the other person can't hear you its the only problem I have to be honest my calls will just go dead you have to mute and unmute yourself to fix it if you didn't know	bug report
Fine until you stop me from getting verification code and thereby stopping me paying you brilliant greedy people could give a grace period	bug report
The app is great and all, but the option to record voice messages won't actually send said messages. I've tried everything, so I'm pretty sure it's the app itself. All in all, it's a great app and I use it all the time.	bug report

Perfect messenger app for me Edit: Changes to prevent sms messages is a huge mistake and will make me stop using signal. A handful of friends and family use it, but absolutely will not if it requires a second messaging app. In an effort to make people adopt signal they are driving away any reasonable person who want privacy without the massive inconvenience of remembering who is on signal and who isn't and mesaaging everyone on the correct app.	feature request
Newest mobile update completely overhauled the app layout, and navigation has become very difficult. On top of that, every time I open the app, the screen is black for a full minute, with nothing loading in for the entirety of that minute. Many people in multiple servers I'm in also share the same dissatisfaction and irritation I do. For all intents and purposes, this update was a step backwards, and a very bad one.

Although there is free messaging and voice calls . The voice calls are choppy hard to have a convo . Too many adds its makes the app super slow.

App has become increasingly more buggy. My audio has suddenly changed to me sounding like I'm in a tunnel with bad connection when It used to work fine. When I check chat messages, the voice chat window takes forever to get back into, I have to click it multiple times before it responds. When trying to click on people's icons in voice chat to change their volume, it takes multiple times to click it and when trying to use the slider for volume it is broken.	bug report
Keeps on saying not responding and won't let me open my text	bug report

I put 2 stars because it's a good app but if your phone is broken then you must use Wi-Fi to make it work right thats only 1 star the second star is for good calls but the 3 stars that are not used are because if your a person who know how to text fast and you know how to text without looking this isn't a app for you because i text fast and when you text to fast the app glitches out add you must resend message so good but bad app	bug report

The new UI is bad. Actually, I just reinstalled it from Play Store and I got the old UI back, it's way more responsive and easier to use. But still the new UI was horrible, it was difficult to navigate and super slow especially on old phones, you gotta wait few seconds after clicking a button. It was really bad.	bug report
You managed to destroy a once useful app. You deserve the worst uncurable illness an angry god can give, your family and kids too	bug report
Uninstalled this trash, since they decided to lock certain messages behind a pay wall. If I wanted to pay, I'd just get another cell phone for the exact same price as your "subscription".

Good volume. Good picture. No disturbances to speach or picture. No bad connections.	irrelevant information
stupidly placed ads, it will interrupt your texting. the app loves to hog memory and will slow down your device considerably, ontop of the fact that your number will get random calls ontop from bots that phish for your information.	bug report
It worked fine until I stared getting a message that my version was old and was automatically logged out so I couldn't use it. Unbelievably rude! I didn't have room on my phone to update, so I just uninstalled it. What a scam.	bug report

Good features and good security are always a great mix. If the conferencing / call / video UI wasn't so imponderable, it would be 5 stars. UPDATE: nice improvement in the app in the last few releases. ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Unfortunately donation badges do not appear and customer support doesn't seem able to fix it.	feature request
Given this update a fair chance, still hate it. Change it back to the way it worked before	feature request
Newest update, once again, is terrible. The layout is clunky and you have to interact with the app far more than before to navigate around. It's no longer an easy transition to check DMs really quickly. Visual & movement fatigue is really setting in with this latest version and I find myself less inclined to use the app. Search feature just does not work well, usually produces no results. When results are produced in DM searches all results come as the DM partner regardless of who wrote it.	feature request

I loved the app and was a major user of it for quite some time! That is until they dropped support for SMS and MMS.

Now, thanks to their decision, none of them are because I had to drop the app! I'm not going to shove Signal down the throats of all my friends just to use Signal.

Please bring back the old ui, at least bring back the button in changing the new one to old. The new one is a downgrade cause instead of easier navigation, it takes more time. Landscaping screen when phone is tilted was the worst. Listen to your users discord.	feature request
Update to overhaul is a prefect example of trying to fix something that isn't broken in the first place. After all this time, I still can't get used to the layout and it doesn't feel natural.

please change back to the original format. this new one feels awful and changing so much of what made the layout good is not great. I, for one, liked having dms up at the top and this more round feel makes it 10X harder to navigate. or at least give everyone the option to put it back the original layout. my previous review would probably be a five but now that this change is in place, I can't really rate it anything higher than a 2.	feature request

The same as all Google apps - it keeps forcing you to 'update' , until 'your device is unable to update'. Thus forcing people to waste the world's resources, and money buying a new and unnecessary product. The app worked without updating. The 'new update' is therefore only beneficial to Google.

Great app! video and audio quality can be improved, but wifi quality probably contributes to that. So far, this app has only had a 3-4 second delay. Others are much worse. I really like the fact that I can use Skype on any device without paying for a phone line. Not sure why, my recently updated version does not have an audio only function. I can't send audio messages. No microphone button included. But overall a very good app.	feature request
Good value for the money I pay. Unfortunately, most people I call in the USA complain that my conversation is robotic and broken up. It improves when not using the speaker but then it is not that convenient when other people need to listen. Not the case when I call other countries.	feature request

Used to be great. Ever since they pushed through some updates this year (Q1 2023) it's been super glitchy and hard to use. Pinned chats don't stay pinned.

As a discord user for 2 years till now, loving the updates that keeps on coming. Although, there are some issues which is about the server channels.

I love discord but it seems like the more updates it gets, the worst it gets. The app used to run cleanly and smoothly for me, but now I'm constantly being glitched into other channels, I can't type when I open new channels, random users accounts pop up mid typing, channels and dms disappear when I open notifications. It seems like the app is just getting worse and worse the more updates it gets, along with some updates being entirely pointless and annoying like font changes.	bug report
so the new mobile UI.. i dont like it so heres everything im not happy with about it. server list area i dont like, please put i back to the right of the chat. the swipe right to reply to a message is kinda useless, everyone will just hold down a message to reply anyways. and lastly i dont like where Direct message and group chats are placed now please put them back. in the end what i want to say is you've made the mobile app to distant from the pc version and i hope you'll reflect on this chang	feature request
It seems to work pretty well. The layout and navigation are difficult to master.	irrelevant information
Very beautiful app for chatting	irrelevant information
Still no group invite notifications! Need more notification options as missing a lot of group invites. Remove group invitations, just add people to a group. End up using WhatsApp group to add people to Signal group.	feature request
i miss the old discord. one if the biggest things i hate about the big update is taht i cant swipe right to see member list. i have to click. also the search is weird. and i think its more work to get to pinned messages. and the set up. the setup sucks i hate it. i never know when i have a new message, because its harder to notice. i hate it	feature request
connection is bad, people can't hear me well.	bug report
I'm giving it a 2 star for now bc for whatever reason it's so damn laggy like I can't even type or do ANYTHING. And no, no it is not my internet bc it's perfectly fine. This is getting so damn annoying that I will probably just delete the app forever. The other apps on my phone are working perfectly fine as well. I hope you can somehow help me fix this problem bc I miss talking to my friends! :[	bug report

No more SMS support. I suppose it's to keep everything involved in their own proprietary system. This is very inconvenient though. Now one must have multipe apps for texting. I did my best to get everyone in Signal. But not everyone wanted to switch over. So I like many other users, I will hang on for a bit. But ultimately, Will be deleting. Being able to have everyones messages in 1 app is more important than having encrypted messaging. I am also pulling my funding for this.	feature request
Very convenient app to use when you don't have any more time left on your regular cell phone plan üòÅ However I have had a few bad experiences with the app also. Like it has a.ind of it's own when making or trying to recieve phone calls	feature request

I've used discord for a very long time I've been of and on it since 2017 however since 2019 I've stuck with it and used it daily.

I'm not sure if it's a bug but images no longer fit within the screen (in portrait mode of your mobile) and I don't like how image now get bunched together and cropped on what you see if sent together.	feature request

A very great app, for private conversation and has a comparatively simple UI. Has a lot of features similar to WhatsApp or telegram, Upsides: 1. You can even schedule messages(not available in WhatsApp or telegram yet) 2. No data tracking. 3. Has open source encryption, so your chat is yours only. Some downsides are that 1. signal doesn't have a messages pinning feature, unlike telegram and WhatsApp. 2. while telegram and WhatsApp is used by masses, signal has a relatively smaller user base.	feature request

Signal was great when it supported both SMS and their proprietary format. I used it as SMS for most people, and some happened to join signal and that was a little bonus.

i think this is a great app to text on but not to call. you have to pay or watch alot of adds/videos to get calling minutes.so if you want to call this might not be the app for you but if you just text then you should get the app.	feature request
Discord is very useful and has easily become my primary form of social media for years. I like it, but the latest change to the UI was not a great move. The new update is buggy and slow and kicks me out of calls for no reason. I don't think it's unintuitive, but it's such a drastic change that was really unneeded since it was already intuitive before. It is also no longer consistent with the desktop version, so you will have to learn both separately. Very annoying	bug report
Always fails to connect calls or give me minutes	bug report
Haven't tried it yet!	irrelevant information
I would give this 4 or 5 star but this app is kind of embarrassing. 1: Honestly the ads at the bottom of the keyboard are annoying because when I am typing I always press the ads. 2: I wish some of the stuff was more free like verification codes and a lock in number because for me, I don't have a phone number, and if you wanted to use something like whatsapp or signal, stuff like that, it says that you have to pay to get verification texts. So I'm asking, please make more things unlocked.	feature request
Has had some interesting UI changes. New users won't know what's up, but for the rest of us the new changes are jarring, clunky, and awkward to get around compared to the original UI. Desktop is untouched... for now. But who knows what the big suits up at Out Of Touch HQ want next?	feature request

With the new update, i can confidently say that this is one of the buggiest, problem ridden apps I've ever used, with a team of people who dont care about user experience nor any semblance of a usable UI. I can't send images, app buggs out and crashes in calls, and they removed the option to revert back to the original ui	bug report

I've been using it for years now and it's okay. It has everything needed and more. However, there are minor differences between the platforms.

When I play a specific game on my computer it doesn't show it in my status while playing, though it does with other games from the same launcher or for other users.

Interesting corporate suicide. Why an app would decide to alienate the entire US customer base so they could better compete with the big baddies on the thing the company cares about, at the cost of an enormous chunk of the userbase. The goal was admirable, the chosen means to achieve this goal were drawn in crayon and smeared with drool. Dumbest thing I have ever seen in this space, which is a mouthful, and the doubling down by the devs is a spectacle to behold.	irrelevant information

The absolute worst, I understand lag and audio drops but this app will randomly end calls, for no reason. Furthermore this "company" earns money each time you view an ad which is why they give you minutes. However the app will take two minutes per forty seconds at times and take minutes for calls that never connect. The quality of calls is absolutely wretched. With my cell being the only thing connected to the network I regularly have poor quality or no connection. Do not download this app.	bug report
Nice working	irrelevant information
All in all it's a good app. The drawbacks are that tou can't see if people are online, you can't make polls and there is no button for these short round videos(like in Telegram). Everything else has been great so far.	feature request

It's legit. Use all the time. Literally a second personal number. You don't have to worry about your main number being used for things or given to people you'd rather not have your main line involved with. Totally awesome won't find a better one than this. Although it can be choppy in calls, drop calls, hard to connect or send messages sometimes but not enough to not use an you should not use the app for important things. If quality of calls was better it would be 5 not 4 stars.	bug report

There is a lot of bugs with this software and some major usability issues. Usability issue: after every other call, a full screen add appears and for 20 seconds I cannot use my phone at ALL. I cannot close the app down or do anything else. Bugs: I often have to exit out of the program a few times to listen to a single voicemail. Secondly, When on another call via my main line, TextNow shuts off my speaker when an incoming call comes in.	bug report

Never let me down, until 2years later. Am on beta to give feedback for updates. Then, by 2023, they decided to give up on SMS, meaning "find another all-encompassing message service" .

This app is horrible. It keeps getting worse and worse. First, every couple days the messages are delayed and then my phone goes off with a multitude of backlogged messages when it catches up. Second, posting is difficult when it fails and you have to try to resend multiple times before it finally goes through. And third, which is also the worst, it drains my battery to the point where I have to charge my phone 3 times a day. I wish I could use a different app but this is what my job uses.	bug report

Reliable, secure and lots of great features, no pop-up ads interfering with its use. Clean, safe, reliable. Signal makes all other E2E encrypted (and non encrypted messaging services) inferior. There are more "popular" (well known) similar apps that in my opinion, everyone should migrate from, and TO SIGNAL. Hat goes off to the developers. Thank you. Keep up the great work! Maximum stars and thumbs up!	irrelevant information
Bought sim card. Then paid $9.95 but phone would not call without wifi. Couldnt receive either. Of course no data provider (textnow) either. $15 wasted. They should refund my payment.

This is absolutely the worst application to use for a phone app. It never wants to connect. It slows down your entire phone. It intentionally drops your phone calls. Don't ever have an important phone call on this app. I know this for certain because while on a call my signal is at the strongest it can be and after 2 or 3 min on the call it starts beeping saying "poor network connection" won't reconnect to call yet while still in call run speed test with great wifi.

The only real thing that set signal apart from every other encrypted messaging app is that it supported SMS.

It's a good app, especially for communication. Although I've had an issue earlier today where my entire app wouldn't load and said I was on a call I wasn't on which i couldn't turn off whatsoever. Only way I could fix it was to uninstall and reinstall it. Other than that, it's great :D	bug report

This app was and is very useful for me, because at one point I had let my minutes run out and (text now) allowed me to continue to make and receive calls and texts and for me that's important for me to stay working.

Just make it optional like you had it. Please, there is no way to change it back right now. It makes no sense to take away the button, and I hate it, and don't you dare give me that link of "check out all the new things" I don't care I like the old version and I want it back!

Only critque, I don't mind certain fam members having access to my phone for some stuff, but sometimes a family member will grab my phone as soon as I set it down and looks through messages. Timer in app is fine, but not full proof either. A separate pass code or pin than my phone's pass code would be nice. I would much rather set a separate code to access the app to ensure optimum privacy. I don't want to have to delete msgs all the time either w the timer feature. Food for thought..	feature request

It's a great app for group communication, I just wish there was a way for group leaders to make special announcement messages rather than just using normal messages for that purpose. That way you can filter out actual important messages from just casual chatter in a big group chat, and you're not bombarded with notifications that 99% of the time aren't about something you're interested in.	feature request

My only lifeline and it didnt live up to my expectations as I thought it would :( hopefully it gets fixed. Edit: okay I managed to log back in but that really stressed me out.	bug report
This is a stupid app. I just signed up for the first time, and it gave me an error message saying my "account was disabled" and I "violated the terms of use" when I haven't used the app and didn't pass the sign up process. It's kind of a scam, isn't it? I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone.	bug report
I like the app overall but now for mobile the call hangs up after 3 minutes of nobody being in the call at least for me and I dislike it I want to be able to stay in the call for days even if no one is there however the other updates are alright I haven't seen anything I haven't liked but that so yeah :) (please if you can get rid of that I am on my knees BEGGING)	bug report

This app used to be a great default texting app for Android. Removing the ability to use the app for sms makes it no better than GroupMe or discord though. It's just another chat app now.

Discord's recent UI update is, for lack of a better term, out of touch. Somehow, instead of making it easier to navigate, they made it more difficult and almost unbearable. Not everything needs its own tab to click on and scroll through; swiping from one side to reveal servers/DMs was easy and relatively simple. Also, why group the server members with the search function? These decisions ultimately complicate a chatting app which prides itself on being accessible and easy to use.	feature request

It's great software, but the removal (WHY?) of SMS text message support is a huge step backward for Signal. Now, instead of managing all my messages in one convenient location, I have to juggle two apps - one for the 10% of my contacts who value privacy, and another for the remaining 90% of the world who either don't care, or who use something other than Signal. What a bone-headed move. Cutting off SMS only means that Signal users will fall back to whatever app supports the most contacts.	feature request

The UX changes are awful and make the app harder to use. Nothing in an app or site should take more than 3 taps to get anywhere. It kinda just tells me they didn't have any concurrent users testing it (WHICH THEY SHOULD BE- AS THEIR TARGET AUDIENCE) prior to pushing the changes. Yes it might be Prettier and seem better organized than before, but switching between a server and a dm was 1 swipe 1 tap before. Now its at least 5 taps.	feature request

It has its ups and downs. You can and will hate some updates that are decided upon, but otherwise, the app is fine. My issue currently is that for some reason, Discord is stuck with an auto-rotate despite my phone being portrait locked. This is apparently a bug that Discord just hasn't bothered fixing according to some, which is disappointing. The only way to fix it is to delete and reinstall, which I'm assuming is a bandaid solution and it'll come back later.	bug report

Will not let me join servers, scroll properly, etc with current update. It is laggy and practically unusable. Disboard won't allow for joining of servers and its very rickety overall. Update: Runs smoother, but annoyances galore. Like friends in notifs. As well as swipe to the right replies instead of showing the right pannel where all who's online / offline is. It is very annoying and is a hassle to navigate this more than the prior update did. Upsetting really.	feature request

The new update was awful. Images don't display properly on mobile, and I can't select an image to send and then type in the same message.

Functioned great before the newest UI update.

5 Stars could have been given because Textnow, for Canadian phone number holders, offer free calls to many countries eg USA, UK, etc. There are good looking numbers and although there's a lot of spam calling called by another VoIP number etc, benefits of having a textnow member outweigh costs. ! One star removed for: they unplugged my number to someone else. ! One star removed for: now their pricing model makes no sense and it does not match their mission statement.

Used to be great, used it for all my encrypted and sms communications. With the removal of sms, it lost half of its usefulness.

This app seems to get worse with every update. My boyfriend got the new layout update and it is absolutely impossible to navigate and is a nightmare to use. This app no longer feels like discord.

Great way to ruin a near-perfect app. The update is and remains trash, only now we remain stuck with it. Additional features continue backwards progression, like image handling.

Though TextNow (TN) does provide much needed free cell phone service, the app and service can be problematic. I can't complete calls to a certain carrier, for example, and before the SIM upgrade, I got very poor service here in the Bronx, NY.

Requiring we use the TN app means we can't fully utilize our COSTLY phones' settings, etc. AND ALL my calls show AFTER the caller has hung up...!	bug report

If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It looks awful & is quite confusing to use now. Yet another example of regressiveness in the name of "progress".

While I understand where the company is coming from, removing the SMS support will not end well. I believe that Signal has overestimated their reach as a lot of people are using Signal for the unified SMS platform and there will be droves of people leaving when the support ends.

Was good until they decided to make it signal users only. It was my primary messaging app until then. I can no longer communicate with people who do not have signal, which is necessary. I'm not going to invite my boss to signal and demand her to have it since the app only allows signal to signal users instead of signal to some other sms app. Uninstalling due to this "new feature."

The service has improved. Calls are clear. Texts come through and video call works. Sadly paying for the upgrade is useless if your phone doesn't already have service. I was hoping to use even when I'm away from wifi. But that is not the case. Up side, it IS FREE as long as you have WiFi or data, you will have a way to stay connected.	feature request
It's not the best uta ok	irrelevant information
uh. Aside from allowing u to call n text even if u don't got a phone plan. It seems like it doesn't use new ones. In the sense that ull see people msging "u" thinking u were the same guy as the person who used that phone #... Makes for a good read ha.	irrelevant information

I used this app when I didn't have a phone, and I came back to use it really quickly. Only to learn, you have to pay just to receive a verification code.

The UI change was not only unnecessary it's worse to use. I've been using discord for years pc and mobile, this is unacceptable and a blatant failure that discord has refused to even acknowledge.

MAJOR downgrade. Not only is the new layout ugly, my god is it hard to navigate, clunky, constantly breaks, resends messages a number of times, images don't work half the time, swiping to see the server list.... just everything about the new update is horrible.

contact permission required because I without it I wont see who's calling or texting me? really? that's the best excuse you can come up with for selling my information? that response makes no sense. if that's the case you wont be stating its "required". people who arent good with technology will think they have to give permission to use the app. nice wording.	bug report

New UI update is awful, strictly worse and less intuitive than what was live for years. Please revert	feature request
I'll be honest I use 2 phones with this app and both are annoying. 1, the app doesn't show people's status and it disconnects as soon as I leave the app. 2, I can't even call on. It won't connect no mater what WiFi I'm on. It could just be a bug with the phone so I am letting it go but the other thing is the mere amount of useless updates they add. I miss the old discord. Plus there is a glitch on the first phone where I can't send more than one image.	bug report

i've been harsh with my last review. the new design is nice. it feels much more like a mobile app than a port of the desktop version. (post the ‚ú® emoji and tap it then hold it again) i found out how to copy tenor links, so thats a plus. the new design does feel much slower, as it is harder for me to get to folders and such.

This is a stupid app. It's changed. Now you can't send direct messages anymore. It says the other person has to add you as a contact. So I have to post the link in the group chat first I guess? It didn't used to be this way. Useless now	bug report

I've been using this app for a cpl years now. For some reason, in the past few months, I haven't been able to copy/paste, and I cannot see any videos sent to me - they won't load.

it's alright sucks u can't make calls	bug report
Love the app, have used it and it's predecessor TextSecure for well over a decade. But I hate that it's no longer going to support sms as well, as having all those messages in one place was convenient and being able to store them in the same encrypted container as Signal messages was a nice bonus. Very frustrated.	feature request
Sucks!!!! Can't dial out to most numbers,  doesn't get text back, most texts I send never get there and it NEVER rings when someone calls.	bug report
Works well keeping our group together and on task.	irrelevant information
While I do love this app and use it all the time, this latest update is a little disappointing. I did really like when the app had the feel of the desktop version. It still works well, some stuff took me a second to find bc it was moved around. My big thing is I have the galaxy z flip 4 and i used to be able to call ppl on discord with the phon half flipped and the app would shrink to the screen, but now it doesn't do that. It just cuts off the screen as if u were only looking at the top half.	feature request

If I try to open the app by clicking anything other than the shortcut on my home screen, the app just goes black.

It banns me as soon as I make an account for no reason	bug report
New layout is extremely confusing and laggy. While i do like that previewing voice activity let's you scroll now, the DMs are awfully hard to use and wrap your head around. Same goes for servers, why reply is by default on a swipe when before it was to preview member list, I don't get why. Another huge issue is the search function, things like from: and has: are straight up missing now and it only looks for words in active channel. Please do something about this. Using this app daily hurts now.	feature request

I also opted to get the free sim card over a year ago and never received it or notification if they ran out. overall lackluster app that needs to be greatly improved.

Ok backup. Ads are intrusive and annoying. There are permissions that are completely unnecessary for example, they want to be able to record calls, why? They wont let you receive verification codes.

Its a good service. The only problem is with calling. If you need to dial an extension or push extra numbers to get to a certain vm it doesn't allow.	feature request
I am not a fan of the new layout with DMs in a separate section. There's no way to go from a specific DM to a server without backing out of the DM entirely. Which is not helpful when trying to converse about something from a server. It honestly feels like a fix looking for a problem.	feature request
Well it's just freezes too much.	bug report

Cannot recommend. As a messaging app it's average and does not support SMS messages. So you have to manage all your messages in different apps.	feature request
It's okay to use in emergencies.... My internet speeds are top notch in my area, but this app still seems to struggle. Call quality is decent most of the time as long as your phone isn't receiving anything. If a REAL text comes through in the middle of a call, your connection is TOAST because the advertisements really do their share of interfering as well.	bug report
Completely intolerable amount of spam	irrelevant information

No longer free. The features I was using it for are no longer free so uninstalled. Reply to Dev: I was mainly using it to receive verification text messages but no longer lets me get them Edit: paid for said service TextNow rep stated I needed to use for verification in response to my review. Paid multiple weeks and still unable to receive verification text from every website I tried it on, 4+ sites. The number I have also when Googled was previous used to protest against an execution in AL.	bug report

Eh it's ok I guess. Calling worked with decent quality on the 2 calls i made, but the texting is atrocious. Only about half my texts are sent, the other half look as though they have been sent, but the receiver never gets them so I have to constantly resend. Annoying. UPDATE 8/31/18: calling works when it wants to doesn't even ring majority of the time on outgoing calls constantly claims its dialing but never is. claims my connection is weak but i never switched from the same connection i had when the app actually was working. probably will uninstall not even worth the trouble I'm being put through.	bug report

I really love discord. It's so great! But the latest update is THE WORST. It's so bad. It's not more organized or anything, it's terrible. There was no need for a change.

Barebones messaging app. Don't see much the point to this over other apps like Telegram or WhatsApp that do it better except maybe for privacy since you don't see people's numbers in groups. Pros: Simple enough to use, not much to figure out. Cons: Link previews take forever to show up, emojis are ugly and limited (just use the standard ones), the "heart" emoji on messages feels a little it off place.	feature request

i can't do any of the action things to earn money. i receive an ear Everytime i try to click on one to do. also, my calls usually end quickly because after a call of minutes the other person cant hear me but i can hear them or neither of us can hear the other person.

New layout is unintuitive and overcomplicated. This isn't me complaining about my muscle memory and having to adapt - these changes make no sense, make the app annoying and confusing to use and feel like they're forcing features from other messaging apps for the sake of being like them at the expense of the user experience. I have little faith any of this will change; devs are historically unwilling to listen to feedback it's a wonder they even have a feedback feature.	feature request
I use discord daily, and the new update just rearranged things for no good reason and added another click to simple procedures. Discord has been making non-user friendly decisions for the past year or two. If you are considering joining or downloading the app for the first time I would not recommend it.	feature request
It is lacking a way to correct mis-said sent statements. Quirky issues occur with adding new people to list. Difficulty with recovering old accounts or changing passwords.	feature request

Extreme limitations frozen in time... I have used Signal for a long time and I have never seen meaningful improvements to key limitations. I can't use it to securely message my iPad- and Mac-using kids, because they don't have phone numbers. I can't use it on the go from my WearOS watch, because without an app I can't open existing message threads or initiate an exchange. Being able to reply from a message notification is just not good enough, but Signal developers seem to think it sufficient.	feature request
Works as described.	irrelevant information
This new update has knocked my rating down a lot. The new UI is difficult to get used to, and removing the ability to easily swipe between the servers and individual chats is annoying. That as well as having friends icons at the top of the chat section, makes it even more difficult to see who is online compared to a simple sidebar. Apps changing their UIs to look similar to one another is my biggest pet peeve, because I am not on this app because its similar to others, its the complete opposite!	feature request

Been using this app for over 7 years, it's great for gaming with friends and finding new communities. Though the updates are only just bearable throughout the times, having some updates that actually fix or improve issues.

As of recently with these updates to "improve" mobile discord (by that I mean within a year or two), it just feels as if it's been getting worse; the lag, the difficulty sending images, moving channels, deleting messages, etc. At this point I much more prefer to use discord on my laptop than on phone anymore, especially after this odd layout navigation update which in my opinion sucks.	feature request
-2 stars for the irritating never going away notification banners. Otherwise it deserves full rating for the call quality. Skype is the most irritating application I have on my phone.

I can't receive calls, it just goes straight to missed. Even if I'm in the app when I try to receive the call. This is a huge bug and needs to be fixed asap. Other than that, this app is fantastic.	bug report
You can do what ever you would like on this app	irrelevant information
You can send and recurve texts but you can't make calls nor receive calls. I have restarted my phone, updated the app, signed in using a different email AND uninstalled the app and installed it back and it's still doing the same thing.	bug report
I used to love Skype but the app is a mess, all thanks to Microsoft. Just a few issues: I can't change my username, apparently Skype For Business is different, Skype call subscriptions do not always include all landline numbers but may exclude some numbers, and finding friends using their Skype ID does not work well.	bug report
Its a good app besides the constant adds on your screen while your trying to type. It takes FOREVER to actually send anything because of ads always pops up. Calling is no good anymore, sometimes someone will call me and I wont get it. Texts sometimes come in hours late or a day late.	bug report

U guys keep messing up my notifications and i need to keep reinstalling the app fr it. Massive hussle	bug report
I gave permission for it to do everything. Yet, when I get missed calls it won't let me see from who. Nor does it even show up. So when I go to missed calls there is nothing there. It will tell me in my notifications under "Call Management" but when tap on it, it disappears & nothing happens.	bug report
I use this almost exclusively for text and it has worked quite well for me over the past year or so. But even tho i txt almost every day, I'm now getting a NAG to use my number or lose it. Whys that if im using it almost daily? And if its because im not voice calling (who does that anymore), then that needs to be made clear (and perhaps you should change your name from "Text Free" to something else) lol.	feature request

New ui is buggy and makes everything harder. Most people swipe things on their phone so it makes no sense to take away the mobile versions most valuable asset. Reverting to the old one would be better and make the community happy.	feature request
Ah communities. Funny, dumb, mildly infuriating, cringe and many more. I'd say the idea of having thousands talk with eachother through either chatting or voice calls is really good. Just people minding their own business and suddenly get a voice call from their friends is absolutely great. Although scams and hackers are still around, please fix those.	irrelevant information

Notifications are not working at all after the update. I have checked the app and my phone, and everything is set right. It's just frustrating cause I use this app more than texting, and I have to check it often due to it not letting me know when someone messages me. Otherwise, I love the new look!	bug report

For the love of God, add the ability to disable discord call sounds already. No, I'm not talking about push notifications. I'm talking about how I can hear every mute, join, stream start, stream end, or deafen. You have the ability on your desktop app. Also what's the deal with video calls just freezing every time you hop to a different app/chatting with someone else during the call in discord. Have to shut down the call and rejoin, or commit to never touching my phone when Im voice chatting.	feature request

The one thing that's  ad aboit it is so huge that it brings this app from a 5 star to a 3 star. Who thought it was a good idea to allow EVERYONE to remove from the chat?  You have people whose hobby literally js to make their way into random chats to "Smoke" them (remove everyone). It's been like this since i first started using this app in 2014. I hate it so much that I left it for kik, but id rather use this. And I know a ton of people who have done the same. So if you don't like 2nd place then fix it.	feature request

everything was fine until the new update got released. The UI is not intuitive - things that were 1 click away before are 3 to 4 clicks to do. It's jarring and inefficient. Poor UX. Its change for the sake of change. The in-call screen and its options is also terrible. Why is everyone floating on a background that is NOT in line with everything else in app? The stream and user volume is a whole treasure hunt to find now. everything is so much slower now too I unsubscribed to nitro due to this.	feature request

Everything is broken. I have to mute and unmute my mic every time I call someone. Often, no matter where I tap or swipe can I even access said mic button. Random buttons stop responding to taps.

Video quality is good. But there should be an option for individual Zoom-in preference. I mean suppose in a video conference there are 5 participants.
