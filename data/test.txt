I used Skype for my Long distance relationship and it worked fine up until recently. Anytime I use Skype on my phone theres no audio and can't connect. When I use it on my laptop it will occasionally lags and buffer and it's not my internet cause when I use it on my PC it works just fine. Overall not too bad long term I'd recommend you use something else.	bug report

please can we get this app in a lite version smaller	feature request
I find this app impossible on samsung s8 ... on a 40+ mb wifi connection it says poor connection, which when informing me dominates the screen with the error message and sound blinking away ruining what little broadcast i'm recieving . The ipad just about holds its own and the iphone 5s holds the connection better than most. It appears from this that the skype app is unable to cope with newer advanced cameras (in the s8) is jittery on the larger ipad screen ...  macbooks and any cross over device from apple to andriod seem to have poor quality. And concidering its now in the hands of microsoft the app became conciderably worse than as an independent provider . Microsoft have probably pumped more investment in to it looking pretty rather than functionality which defeats the object of staying in touch through communication. Please stop sitting on profit and invest in this program and app to return it to the best . Possible solution might be allowing users the set call video quality in order to retain a functioning video image ???	bug report
Very good & Very nice	irrelevant information
The login needs to be wifi friendly because when your phone is off they don't allow certain wifi numbers to be used because some require a payment to get codes.	irrelevant information

Find in conversation doesn't work.	bug report
I still can't figure out to place a call from my contact list on my phone. The absolute worst app design that won't allow you to call. The more they change the app, the worst it gets. 2 years later and still unhappy about this app. The issue with contact list of my address book still not showing is still there. On top of that, very slow loading and navigating or calling, even though on the latest of android phone or tablets with lots of ram.	bug report

Slowest app on the planet	irrelevant information
Now spammers have found my Skype number, and I can't remove their come-ons or block them.	feature request
The overall app is great. Skype is the best application I have ever used to hold my meetings. It has a nice Ui which is focused on the ease of access and use. And it's the best alternative to zoom. But the issue with this application is, it's unresponsive in the first couple of minutes after opening the application. In the pc, it's performing at it's best and there's not any issue with that. Please fix this bug.	bug report
The app is very slow every time I opened any chat it takes more than 40-50 seconds sometimes it takes more than a minute. Please improve the speed of this app.	bug report

It does work properly. Always shows connecting sign. Messages doesn't deliver immediately.	bug report
Good for chatting.	irrelevant information
Sometimes messages are not being sent or received. It is really annoying. But the audio part on Android is fine. Also new app design is laggy on old devices, I think it could be smoother.	bug report

Getting hanged multiple times even during installation itself	bug report
I can login to my account but after that it seems like the app just cant connect to anything. Can't see contacts except the last few i i sent messages to from other devices previously. Those i can see has no status indications or whose online. Used to use an older version that had way more functions and information displayed. Honestly feels like there are stuff missing that has been removed. Apparently they are going for a new 'minimalist' style but they removed everything instead of finding ways to display stuff compacted and in a useful manner. Would really not recommend this version to anyone.	feature request
Not reliable, on either fibre or 4g. Widely used but I can't recommend it.	irrelevant information
Often seems somehow heavy /slow to function yet I feel happy with it totally .	irrelevant information
Everytime caal endedi dont know why	bug report
This app keeps on logging me out! The only reason I use it because of my friend's, the quality and connection is bad! Do not recommend!	bug report
Personally didnt like it	irrelevant information
Overall good experience. But didn't like the Add friend feature. There must be an option to find contact.	feature request
Good connectivity....holds a connection better than Whatsapp. Great for calling family, friends. Weakness: confusing user interface, cluttered logs, unclear how to commence call, menu navigation poor, in-call adjustments cause screen to disappear. Poor conference calls: No ability to schedule calls ahead, can't create link for broadcast to unspecified participants (a key failing...Zoom is better at this). Overall excellent for casual chats between people who have pre setup Skype IDs.	feature request

It doesn't matter what I've changed my status before, it is always reset to active. If I tap on notification message, the app never shows the latest messages and always give me very old messages. Sometimes I cannot enter to one of the group chats or my contact profiles either. it doesn't matter how much tapping on them.	bug report
Labels are very useful especially for business. It should be added	feature request

I hate the latest updates. It has made the app so pretty that it basically didn't work. You can't easily see new messages, when they load half my screen is taken up by the unless curvy lines. It's harder to find people based on their pictures. Overall, massively destroyed this app.	feature request

app crashes every time that i open it and whenever i text someone i cant see their replies.	bug report
Please stop removing emoticons such as penguinkiss, which was one frequently used between my hubby and me. We were both very upset to see this one removed. Call quality is poor and is not our Internet connections. Audio is poor during video calls as well. App quality started decreasing with base formatting updates. Please fix these issues. Also, one I have complained about before... on mobile app, we have to constantly quit the app and restart it because delays in keyboard and text synchronization happen, and it gets to where it's impossible to use.	bug report

I can't make call in group with 100 members. also it has a lot of bugs.	bug report

Xiaomi mi 8. I can't answer an incoming call. There is no reply button. How can this inoperable product be released into production?	bug report
The new theme is silly! Add features like better chat experiences, channels in groups etc instead of silly squiggly animations	feature request
It used to work perfectly but now it won't even let me send a single message for no reason. Then it will repeatedly send my previous messages automatically. Wished the developer would do something about this.	bug report

Send files should store for long time , not for only 1 month	feature request
Good app. Consistent for the most part.	irrelevant information
It was fine but with the latest updates simple functions like sending message stutters. What's the point of the app, when everything just doesn't respond.	bug report
Good app if u got a mate in prison setup a virtual machine number so my mate pays 2dollars in prison rather then 7bucks pretty good deal	irrelevant information

Best app for offical works and for office use , mostly i recommends this app for the call centre purpose. Really nice app. Eligible for five stars.	irrelevant information
best conferencing app	irrelevant information
I used to love Skype but its lack of features on Android astounds me. For a start I can't edit or create phone Contacts so what use is that? I have to type in numbers from my contacts in the phone or use cut and paste which then wipes out the UK country code! So I first have to edit the phone contacts to include that code if its not already there then cut and paste again. And I found my Skype call credit had been disabled for some reason and what a process it was to get that reinstated. Sorry Microsoft, I expect better of you, its almost as if you don't want to support Android, is it sour grapes I wonder?	feature request
this app is amazing you can save bods number and call them you should dollow this app i promise you wont regret it	irrelevant information
Any app which can detect that who is removing from call on Skype??	feature request
Can't even open links. Just throws error pop-up at the user. It should not be that hard to fix but more than a week I have to copy links and open in browser. And stop playing back Youtube videos inside the app. Open native app instead. The user experience is terrible	bug report
Great,always realiable,speech ,text,video,perfect for social chat or the Doctor!	irrelevant information
I'm not sure what they were thinking when designing this app but it seems like they totally ignored how every other app is built. It is extremely confusing to navigate. Not intuitive at all. Way to go.	feature request

I use this app to talk to friends who live in other states. I gave it three stars because of some it's thing . Be sure to use this app alot your it won't connect and nothing will load.	bug report
Eating lot of battery while just texting with Skype. had to force stop if not using app.	bug report
"Okay but not great app. One thing that is annoying and quite dangerous to be honest when you call someone on the on-ears sound settings, when the other person is not answering or hang up the sounds switch to speaker settings automatically (I have no idea why) which blast a very very loud sound (""disconnected sound"") on your hear. I had to see a doc after that. So please be careful with that."	bug report

"Used to be one of those ""good enough"" messengers, but it has gone downhill a century ago. Video quality is incredibly bad, some messages just flat out refuse to be sent (or recieved), and the app itself is really hard to use. Same goes for the PC version. Not worth it to use, just use some other messenger app."	bug report
Uninstalled because it logged me out for no reason, and to log back in I needed to do a recaptcha whish was IMPOSSIBLE. Even the audio version was impossible to understand. I guess I can't use it anymore	bug report
Great All around	irrelevant information
Am frustrated with this app. The words are so small I strain to see things, find things. There is so much empty space...why can't the words be larger? I ordinarily don't use glasses to use my laptop....but then I need them for Skype. I use it to be in touch with some friends and the voice quality is perfect.	feature request
Doesn't show messages sometimes. Sometimes doesn't allow you to search for chat groups. Won't allow uploading of images or files. Calls work well which is good, but otherwise, the app is done very poorly in comparison to the mobile and desktop apps on other devices/PCs.	bug report
This app is overall pretty good. It is a free way to chat with friends and family. Though it can be quite laggy. I try to change my profile picture and it makes the picture really tiny in the left side corner. It can take a while to load chats or voice/video call someone. Please fix the lag and glitches.	bug report
I'm disappointed that Skype doesn't work well anymore. When we try video call, audio and video stop from time to time. I hope this will fix soon or we'll transfer to another to another app	bug report
Very poor quality video. Makes me angry. Blurry, glitchy (video and audio), and always freezing.	bug report

So far good. Although, the keyboard is flashing white when minimizing. Does Skype have encryption?	bug report

I've been using the Skype app for over two years and today it decided to remove all of my gallery on there. Skype has also been bad with the messaging. It won't send the messages half of the time and won't receive the messages while in app. Please fix Skype, thank you. 9/10/18 Now they've added read receipts. This app just keeps getting worse.	bug report

I'm having good issues with videos. They're sticking halfway through downloading. It's not a signal issue as I've tested on another device and it only happens on my phone. I'm not overly hating the new version (although I think there's a lot of unnecessary elements being too focused on) but this is incredibly annoying.	bug report
I think the main problem anyone can remove or mute anyone even the teachers Many boys are having fun with this removal game We need a permanent solution . Due to this, many people stopped using this app, now there are using meet. But that's video quality is not good, consuming of high data and charge . The video quality of Skype is good. After the solution we will use this app again. Also the rating will be increase . I don't know what will do Skype pub! We are wating for update. Good luck	feature request

Updates have made the app frustrating to use.  Now every time I log in to Skype, all the hidden contacts & chats appear on the home screen.  I go in & hide them, but then they all reappear next time I open it.  The most upsetting thing is that I had years worth of messages with a close friend that just disappeared when I know for a fact that I did NOT delete the chat history.. & I can't get it back - I've tried everything.  It's very sad, as that person is no longer a part of my life.	bug report

Slow to load text chats, even slower to load media, for 75% of my contacts it refuses to download anything at all, unless it's got a thumbnail. Pictures are working fine (albeit with ridiculously slow loading speeds), voice is working sometimes, videos are working seldomly, on a good day they might get lucky. For anything else you'd better use a file sharing service. Scrolling back further than ~50 messages causes the app to jump around uncontrollably, needing a force close to regain control....	bug report

Laggy and slow This app is very slow with notifications, refreshing, loading and even sending in conversations especially compared to other messaging apps like discord or hangouts. I know my device is cheap but if other apps like it can do the same stuff faster with more response then I would opt out for those instead. The only reason why I have Skype is so I can message friends without other messaging apps. Skype does works stably in other devices like on my Windows laptop and my Ipad.	bug report

I used to love Skype. With recent updates, perks I had relied on before have disappeared.  I used to be able to see the other person's video even while using other apps or navigating on my phone. The new ring is absolutely horrid and it makes me angry every time I make or receive a call. Being in a long distance relationship in this day and age almost requires video calling and it definitely makes every day life simpler and more rewarding when it comes to said relationships. Although, the clarity of the video seems to be getting a little better compared to when I had first updated it a couple months ago, it is still not great. I often hear background noise during the call (both wearing headphones) and the voice can be extremely laggy, causing both parties to interrupted one another. I am very disappointed with these new updates. Another bummer is that when a message is typed, it no longer notifies you on the screen with the text. I would love to give a better review so hopefully they will fix these mistakes.	bug report

Skype has gone from something that used to work to something that does not work or works when you get lucky since M$ bought it. The UI on android is suffering, buggy and slow.

I bought a subscription for calling on the phone and having an incoming phone number. I like the features!

I have wifi in my room, which work too fast for any others app like zoom and Google meet. But when I was added a video call class in Skype, the video of that call was very poor. So can't attend the class hopefully. please help me.	bug report
App crashed in work profile.	bug report
Please bring back the old version! I can't multitask anymore, if I try to open another app I can no longer see whoever I am on video call with, it takes too much time to load up up recent conversations, can't see contact's profiles, no notifications for new msgs without me having to sign in and out etc etc. Is there a way to revert to the old one?	bug report
there is a little drow back in this app which is while on skype class or meeting camera for photo doesn't work to capture photo. It's need to stop conversion then to do it.	bug report

Allow us to block all unknown messages. Getting tons of spam texts, spam calls, and getting added to groups unsolicited. Incredibly annoying. Aren't being blocked even when block calls from non-contacts is turned on & Skype call blocking is turned on. Get 5 spam messages a day. Haven't even shared my Skype number with anyone. Literally insane and so disruptive that I had to uninstall the app. Make your screening way better. Please.	feature request
Right in the middle of trying to Skype I have to input a code to access the site to simply hear the title of a song. What is this? The government? Just songs, nothing more Gee whiz.	irrelevant information
4 stars it's not perfect but it is very very good	irrelevant information
This new update has made Skype slow and confusing to use. It doesn't seem logical to have to click on your profile picture to get to settings. When I'm in a video call the sound quality is bad. This new Skype has lost some great features. You can't even see if your contacts are online or not unless you click on their name. When I send my friends messages, they don't receive them immediately; they are hours late and my contacts don't get notifications every time I send them a message. This update would be fantastic if you wouldn't make things difficult to find and use. It would also be great if you didn't remove the great features the old Skype had. Ex. (Online, offline, away, do not disturb status). If you fix these issues, I will definitely rate 5 stars. Please and thank you!	bug report
I LOVE IT EVEN THOUGH ITS GETTING OLD AND GETS GLITCHY	irrelevant information
It works but it will mess up something	irrelevant information
The last updates are annoying at best and irritating. New icons are not easily understood. Connection and message updating are very slow. The online indicator is incorrect as it shows away when the person is online, it changes to online when they send a message but immediately goes back away.  It is rubbish	bug report
Calls are laggy to the point of uselessness.	bug report
It is very simple, and the audio is very good, I think the only con is that it sometimes randomly disconnects or statics... Other than that I believe it is a pretty good app!	bug report

Used to be the best voip app. Since Microsoft bought it, it glitches all the time.	irrelevant information
It's good BUT, sometimes when I click on the app, it signs me out. Then when I try to sign back in, it says the password is wrong. After more than 5 times of re trying, I've decided that I have given up on Skype. GET WHATSAPP INSTEAD.	bug report

The only reason I'll give 3 stars is because, in the end, it does what it is supposed to do. However, the app is very glitchy, and it will often give you headaches trying to figure it out. Connection issues with bt earbuds, unstable calls, problems changing from bt headphones to speakers... and those issues have been around for a while, which makes me think microsoft just outright wants you to ditch it and start using teams instead.	bug report
Worst app of all time, keeps freezing and nothing works	bug report

Never have problems with using Skype, been using it for more than 10 years, it' Edit: February 2023. In recent months, I have found adding credit to my account not as straight forward as it should.

Sometimes I even get a refund for no reason, leading to repeat the process again.	bug report

Been a user since 2017 and this year has truly felt like a regression in all updates to the ui and app as a whole.

New update is terrible. Downgraded back to an older version. Much better now. 1 star for nitro bloat, pointless ui changes, and the usual corporate greed.	irrelevant information
Pretty good except it won't open on my phone now. Edit: I accidentally sent four reviews, I apologize. I don't know why it did that.	bug report
It used to be a good app, but they just changed the layout on mobile and it is sooo crusty and weird. It used to be smooth and easy to navigate but now it takes 6 seconds to navigate to a server instead of 1 second. Pls change it back discord! Edit: 1 star bc its even worse now	feature request
"First off,the new UI is the worst thing that they could've come as of right now.(12|21|23) Second,all the ""great features"",are only paid to unlock,and what I mean by that is that you need a monthly subscription to their ""Nitro Program""."	irrelevant information
This was updated 6 days ago	irrelevant information
The new update is confusing and completely changed the layout. I am not a fan of it. I understand how to navigate but to me it just adds an extra step and reduces flexibility. Not a fan.	feature request
The UI update makes common functionality less convenient, such as limiting searches to a given channel, and placing the server's user list under a separate menu instead of simply requiring a swipe. The Q&A on the UI update makes it clear Discord's plan is to wait out the backlash. I understand not wanting to let the resources you spent on the update go to waste, but this is honestly enough of an annoyance for me that I'll just use the browser version and cancel Nitro in the mean time	feature request
Verification Number Broken plzzz fix this	bug report
Pretty decent. Not perfect, but it's free.	irrelevant information
I have used discord for about 3 years now and this is the worst update i have ever seen my mobile experience has been completely ruined thanks to your new ui it would be better if there were a toggle to turn it of aswell i cannot send any photos to servers or dms i genuinely loved your app but this update was not the best idea and i think your entire community would agree with me	feature request
"I love this app and how it is layed out, but I often have to uninstall and reinstall because it will occasionally open and all my channels will be gone and it says that it's a ""text only"" channel that I'm on. It's a tad frustrating. But I still love the app."	bug report

You have to pay for everything new. If a new cool feature comes out, you HAVE to pay for it by buying nitro. Why not make everything free for a change? All this is doing is making Discord a cash grab app	irrelevant information
3rd edit of my review, I stopped paying for Nitro altogether after 2 years because it just isn't worth it anymore. The Mobile interface is terrible, and pack-full of bugs that were never fixed. Sucks that I still have to use this, considering there's no other alternative.	bug report

The mobile app is acting weird. Anytime I'm in a group voice chat, we all lag big time. What's goin on with that?	bug report
To be honest, the new design has ruined my experience with discord. There are numerous problems such as 'infinite loading screen when streaming' and 'discord unable to connect back preventing me from sending messages but at the same time the on-going call remains unaffected' and I can't open discord's on-going call screen in mini window because the layout's dimensions don't match with the size of mini window.	bug report
Discord... When I first started using you things were great. Didn't have issues cutting in and out.. you log in it would go straight to speaker on my phone and you could quickly access things if need to deafen or mute.. now however.. there are so many issues in the last 12 months. Cuts in and out frequently (I have not moved), now when you log in it sets audio to phone instead of speaker or no longer auto changing to my handsfree device after plugging it in to the phone.	bug report
New UI is garbage. I will not elaborate further.	feature request
HATE your new update. It's harder to navigate and understand where everything is now. The tabs on the left before made it more convenient to jump between chats/servers and talk to other people in dms. Now it has extra steps in an ugly blue. That was fun to wake up to :)	feature request
Ye, it's good.	irrelevant information
I would give it a lower rating if I could. The new layout is awful, and looks like Snapchat.	feature request
I've been having an issue recently. I can talk in dms just fine, but when in a public server it keeps crashing. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, force stopping the app, but it still crashes. Not sure what to do or why this is happening. Oh, and I also can't send voice messages longer than around 5 seconds. Edit: ah um. I tried restarting my device, didn't work. And I'm not sure how to see if I have the latest version of my os installed..	bug report
"As others have stated, VERY buggy as of late. I recall awhile back, the app's developers had... quote ""taken steps to improve the launch times of the app"". However... after seeing how many times I've had to CLOSE AND REOPEN THE APP just to make it WORK PROPERLY... I'd rather go back to the super long startup time! Please consider this! The ""need for speed"" has caused the reply function to break, channels to not load/freeze, and messages to be sent with incorrect formatting/unexpected newlines!"	bug report

I enjoy this app when it works, I use it with a local mom group that has 10-15 threads going. Sadly every now and then a glitch happens and I can only see the last thread I opened. It means I have to uninstall and reinstall the app each time to see the full group again.	bug report
The made the UX even worse More button presses to do things and it looks more annoying	feature request
why did you update the mobile app?	irrelevant information
fun way to communicate with people who have the same passion as me, some great channels	irrelevant information
Some of the updates have been okay in certain situations, but with the new layout test on mobile being implemented over the past few months to various users, it's made things more difficult to navigate, especially with those who have used discord for years at this point. If Discord wants to make a new layout, that's fine I guess, but there should be an option to choose to use the new layout, much like people could choose the old discord font size that they're used to.	feature request
App itself is great and I love it but the new layout is just horrible compared to the original genuinely the only good thing to take away from this is how you can search for old messages/images yet apart from that it's a downgrade and worst part is you can't just switch back because the option to do so has been removed. It just got worse why does it flash a blue notification every single message and why can't i send images.	feature request
Great service, terrible UI. This app used to be the benchmark for a good UI, but now it is the only app that I have set to not auto update because this new update had ruined everything that was once great. I installed an older version and it is so much better than the latest update. 5 starts for the desktop version and the service as a whole, but 1 star for making the mobile UI more convoluted and frustrating to use.	feature request
Love discord but i never got the new update	bug report
I'm so sorry to leave this review :( I love discord. :( but the new update has made the app barely function... :( Images don't post. Messages fail. Chats are missing ( yes I checked the settings etc.) Chats aren't updating ( I've to check my desktop to see what's been said) Your reply helps in no way. Very disappointing response.	bug report
Used to be a great port from the web/desktop version(s), but the new UI has ruined the experience. It still has most of the functionality, but many are no longer intuitive to put to use.	feature request
"Ever since the new ""update"" today I can't send pictures to servers. It just sends pictures I try to send to severs to the last person I dm'd. According to reddit I'm not the only one with this issue. Please discord fix your awful update so I can send pictures to servers again!!!"	bug report
The redesign was weird, but it's fine otherwise	feature request
app is buggy and glitches out constantly ever since the update to the new UI	bug report
How do you do worse than YouTube on unwanted UX redesigns?	feature request
A lot of the help articles were written pre-update and are not helpful. On my phone the discord app keeps overlapping with system menu bar areas, making those overlapping areas unusable. I tried to submit a bug report but the article on finding client info WAS OUT OF DATE and searching in settings is not showing anything.	bug report
Can't even log in. I have never enjoyed using Discord on my computer. Now, I can't even log into my existing account on my phone. Sorry, Discord. Your name is appropriate.	bug report
It is laggy and stops working in the latest version	bug report
Good app but windows has a problem can you fix it please?	bug report
The name update IS.NOT.IT. I literally hate it and I think a lot of other people do too. It's one of the main reasons people will quit discord. You can't even costumise your name with any special characters or spaces! What a shame .	feature request
The new discord layout is horrific, it attempts to be Instagram when you are in messages and a phone home screen when in servers it's horrible to navigate and annoying to use	feature request
discord, where did my dms go???????	bug report
Since the update the app no longer opens (note; it opened once, but since I closed it it will not open again)	bug report
The new UI causes so many issues. It fails to load messages and images half the time without restarting the app. Sometimes my messages will end up in the wrong channels, which makes this new version a no-go for any private conversations. And that's not even mentioning how the new UI requires so many useless taps and swipes to replicate what we had before.	bug report
I want more nitro LMAO	irrelevant information
"It was a fine app to use before the most recent update. I don't mind UI changes, but they took almost every aspect of Messenger/Whatsapp and just transplanted it (badly) onto their UI. The DM panel is literally copy-pasted from Messenger and the server's channels now mimic group chats (including having to go to ""chat settings"" just to see who is active, instead of a simple left swipe). I applaud the attempt to make the app easies to use on mobile, but i feel a different approach is needed."	feature request
Right now it's a one star because i can't even use discord right now cause I've already verified my number when I first got it but last night all of a sudden the thing thats says please verify your number and I can't even use, i can't message no nothing	bug report
I am facing issue where everything isn't loading whenever I changed profile pictures and I tried several ways to fix it but it doesn't seem to resolve the issue. I hope this gets fixed soon.	bug report
Discord just crashes everytime I type out something, fix this issue.	bug report
Massive disappointment since latest update. The UI is not as efficient and such a mess.	feature request
confusing to use and lots of bugs all my settings are correct yet i cant see other people video and no matter what my screen auto rotates	bug report
ive stopped getting chat notifications for two of my personal servers. ive tried everything- uninstalling and reinstalling, updating, turning notifs off and on again, logging out then back in- nothing. ive already submitted a bug ticket and didnt get much back on it, issue still hasnt been fixed.	bug report
Overall great but we need a way t add ppl automatically if we have added them before	feature request
Ive used this app for 7 years but today they rolled out an update so ill conceived and so ugly that my muscle memory for the layout is completely shot. Theyve changed the layout in a pathetic attempt to emulate apps like snapchat and it feels awful. I intentionally avoid those apps and prefer discord for its ease of use and they have made it more difficult and tedious to navigate than ever. You aren't snapchat, that's what made Discord good.	feature request
This new update is not the best from discord. When on mobile I constantly have to open and close the app because of a glitch that either dose not send a message or the different groups become intertwined when switching.	bug report
I love this app but a lot of times it gives me the update later than everyone else. The app works good, is very clean, and is easy to use and understand as said before my only issue is the app giving me updates late.	feature request
New layout is just terrible, most people I've talked to using discord agree and a few are even livid that you can not change it to the old layout. Having a new layout is fine but it's a better idea to have an option for your preferred layout, don't take away the layout people are most comfortable with using. And I'm sorry, I don't usually complain but this being the easiest way i can contact friends who live in other states or even other countries this just frustrates me.	feature request
The app keeps disconnecting me from a call and i hate it but is still good but fix the bug	bug report
I swear this new update has almost completely rendered the app unusable. Videos crash, emotes won't load, pictures won't load, etc. The only thing I like about the new update is the user profiles they look much better than before; however, the font is too large even with fixing it doesn't work. It just looks off. You should've just left the app the same and only added the new user profile interfaces.	bug report
This is a nice app, but the problem is this lags so much,it atleast takes 20 minutes to get fixed. The new update is hard to use. Please fix this.	bug report
Just getting to about it	irrelevant information
Forcing layout changes is what has caused me to drop many programs in the past please let people opt into changes	feature request
Good overall but can be improved	irrelevant information
"Genuinely love the app but discord is getting buggier with some new updates. My current biggest issue lies within 2 recent features. They are ruling out the number system that accompanies a user's profile, which 1) is not nearly as safe of a system and 2) is just honestly less fun :/ I like changing a goofy username over and over, it's like half the novelty of discord. The other large issue is the 'feature' where they automatically turn vc recording on to ""help train AI"". I turned that off asap."	feature request
I love discord but can we please bring back the old ui on the phone? i find the new one harder to navigate. i get that it's fresh and it's new but i liked the simple look better. other than that, great app! nothing bad to say about it.	feature request
Re-write: My buddy stole my phone and wrote a goofy (joke) one-star review. I would rate this app to be pretty good. There are very few issues technically. Performance is typically good unless they inform us that we should go outside when the servers crash (ha!). However, on a more quality-of-life note, I do wish we could stream faster than 30fps for free. Since 30fps is the limit it, like V-sync is not always reached and as a result sharing things with friends is often negatively impacted.	feature request
Great app, love the new design	irrelevant information
would give zero if i could. bloated content and updates no one asked for.	irrelevant information
I'm sorry the December 2023 update is so bad. extra taps for navigating? Jokes on you we installed the older version.	feature request
I really like the app but some things are horrible in discord I can't send photos now I have no clue why I can't but it won't send them and the new update is just horrible in my opinion I really don't think discord is going to be popular foruch longer with the updates they are doing	bug report
Never works. Can't login. It says different location login check email. Email is there, but link is expired. Everything is always expired. This app should expire.	bug report
Don't really review things, but the new mobile UI is awful. Why would they make things LESS convenient by separating messages and servers into different tabs?	feature request
Downgrade to ver 205.15 or earlier to get the faster and bug-free old UI. Sad to see all the money and effort of the UI overhaul going to waste. Constant freezing requiring force closing of the app as well as removal of AMOLED mode were enough for me to revert to an old version and never look back. Hope Discord can steer away from this direction. It's disheartening to see something you love turn into questionable decision making, especially as a long time paid user.	feature request
app keeps crashing after i updated. fix this please.	bug report
The communication services are still great and the app has generally improved, but a few updates ago they broke images. Now when you click on the it's just a black screen unless you swipe up or down.	bug report
I cant make an account :c	bug report
As discord continues to update, the UI becomes more and more inaccessible. The search function is currently broken and navigating between servers and dms has never felt this clunky. Being forced to use the swipe to reply instead of having it as an option makes the app so much clunkier than one would imagine. Just let me use the old UI, this is a straight downgrade Edit: Not a question of me not knowing how to use the app. The user experience is just horrible. That's before factoring in bugs	feature request
I can't opt out of the new design	feature request
Its good for playing and friends but alot of bullying has happen on there personally and for others and sometimes it would bug out when im typing.	bug report
The update is really laggy and just makes things a lot harder to find. Everytime I go into someone's dm, it always puts me at the very top of the message, where the date is. It's kind of annoying.	bug report
It's kinda boring because you can't get people to join servers but overall fun when you have friends	feature request
It is a ok app it just has so many glitches and one of them won't stop happening where it doesn't connect to my Bluetooth and just plays on speaker when every other app I use it's perfectly fine	bug report

The app as a whole is great and I've been using it for years. However the audio quality for Android users is abysmal. I can go to any other app and I'm heard crystal clear and loud. However on discord... muffled, soft, quiet and they have ti crank up their volumes. What is up? It's not a settings issue either, I have tinkered with every available option and it makes no difference. Fix this	bug report

It's a decent app and all. But the random friend request of scammers and people trying to snatch any kind of info off you is getting old.

Good app but The idiot Devs decided to push out the most horrendus ui update untill that gets reverted no more Than 1 star And fof discords automated response no im not using The most recent version i downgraded my version back to before this horrible update was pushed	feature request
Rating this 1 star because the new UI is terrible, but luckily i found a way to revert it. I won't mention it here because maybe discord will patch it out, but you can find it online. highly recommended. Discord, do not reply to this with a link to your help center on the new UI, I don't need it, you need to revert the new UI because everyone hates it.	feature request
"October 2023 update changed the UI for the worse. Too many drop menus now. For anyone here looking to change to the old layout, here's how. Go to your profile --> go to app settings (the gear icon) --> go to appearance --> scroll down and toggle off ""Show New Layout"""	feature request

Discords new update is such a pain, it didn't ask to update just did and it's such a nuisance, incredibly buggy, not easy or smooth at all and very inconvenient, one part I like is that there is a media tab to look for images that have been sent but that is the only reason I rated it 2 stars, otherwise the new Discord for mobile is terrible	irrelevant information

Very well done made nice ap for game like.	irrelevant information
Hate the new ui and thats not what im giving 1 star for. EVERY SINGLE time i join or start a call MY SCREEN JUST STARTS TURNING ON AND OFF RAPIDLY it is annoying because i have to leave the call and close and reopen the app to fix it but because every .3sec my screen turns on and off its kinda hard to leave the call.

I don't like the new update, and I really don't like how it's not revertable and it bypasses auto-update being off. I understand that Discord is trying to make the mobile app seem less like the desktop version, but I actively like it BECAUSE it's like the desktop. Please at least include a way to revert back to the way it was before.	feature request
I've had discord for about 5-6 years now and I pay yearly for the highest level of nitro, sometimes I don't like the occasional update but they usually don't get in the way of my use of the app. However, the new UI update? Atrocious. All the muscle memory I had for the app out the window in one forced update. It's not as bad as it was in beta but it is in no way good. Not only is it hard to navigate, but it also runs so much slower now and channels take about 45 seconds to load. Insane.	feature request
Decided to force a new UI down our throats despite us not needing one. The old UI is still a part of the app, so you update and they let you have the old UI still before springing the new UI on you. Whichever investors wanted this need to GTFO. Discord refuses to let users go back to the old UI despite it still being in the app.	feature request
The UI and navigation are horrible now. The old UI and navigation were much better	feature request

Pls fix this Discord.	bug report

Discord used to be my favourite texting app but recently there has been an issue where if i click on the cross button to send images the images are not there and my entire app freezes, this does not involve my wifi as i have ran it and it worked perfectly fine so please fix this	bug report
The update made the app unusable and ugly. Whoever thought of this new ui setup should be fired because it is hideous. I have to click through one transistion to another to find anything and since i use push to talk i have to click through 4 different slides and wait for lag inorder to finally say something that could have taken seconds before the update. This update is bad and the backlash is proof.	feature request

Change in ui is awful	feature request
This new UI is horrible	feature request
The mobile app was perfectly fine before the 12/6/23 update. You could easily swipe around places to get to things and all the messages were in the same spot. Now it sucks to try to go between a server and a dm, it sucks to try to get to pins or see the member list, I will not use the swipe to reply feature nearly as much as I used the swipe to view members/pins/search. Switching between servers just sometimes doesn't load the server you switch to and gives you messages from the 1st one instead.	feature request
No. This new update is horrible.	irrelevant information
It's unfortunate that this release turned out so poorly. I understand the direction they're taking the mobile experience and generally agree with the change. However the release is absolutely riddled with bugs making it very hard to really appreciate what is to come for discord mobile. I think they have a good starting point for something better, but also a lot of work to get there. However I'm still left scratching my head on why they removed easily being able to access the members list...	feature request

I love discord but this new update is awful. The contrast in regular dark mode is now so harsh I can't read my DMs without immediately getting a headache. For some it's triggering migraines. The new UI is laggy. Swipe to reply is just a pain, not a help. Navigation is cumbersome, lengthy and clunky to use. And you can tell from the selectable options in the feedback, they know *exactly* what is wrong with it and yet still forced it on people with no way to swap back.

I use this app daily, but it's been acting up the last few months. They release features clearly without proper QA, as the search in the blog feature has been broken until recently. The app is very annoying to use on data connections. Either because of a slow connection or because it's not constant, the app would kind of reload, even in the middle of typing, wiping the typed message so far, or scrolling you all the way down, or stuff like that. Trying to edit a message and false unreads also.	bug report

Used to be good but this username change is insanely bad. nobody asked for this and discord isn't a social media where handles are a thing. Worst change ever Edit: The new UI is also absolutely terrible and I don't think anybody has asked for this useless change.	feature request
Reset my password twice and cant login so something is broken with the app	bug report
i cant open my account on mobile,when i try to log in it gets stuck on the loading screen and doesn't open,but i can open on pc.	bug report

It's good. Voice chat a bit laggy but it's not the end of the world:)	bug report
I used to love it but this new update is horrible. Please change it back. :'(	irrelevant information
I love hainf discord bc I can talk friends bc they don't have tiktok and I can call, text them and I just love having discord on my phone	irrelevant information
This new UI sucks, it's way too condensed for no reason and there's no way to go back	feature request
"I use this app for everything, but the new update ruins the simplicity of the app. Finding people in servers, navigating DMs, and notifications having its own bulky tab are all just *bad*. The pings on servers are all the notifications needed. I hope they roll-back on this update. Put this ""graphic design is my passion"" nonsense to rest."	feature request
Ayo discord the new two updates before this current new update were good and fine. These new ones ain't it. Its more annoying and difficult to navigate than the older ones. Please reconsider these new updates for the app since I just don't think it was needed or even necessary.	feature request
Whatever this recent update was completely trashed my app. Everything freezes after 2 seconds now. Can't access any of my servers or messages without having to close and reopen the app several times.	bug report
I used to love this app and now it is terrible. I refuse to use it on my phone until it is fixed.	irrelevant information
Hey Discord, I'm on a mobile device. And Everytime I enter a voice call and my hand gives over my camera my screen turns black and it glitches	bug report
I would have been able to give discord a 5 star because up until recently, I've been able to connect to all servers and really like all the features that come with it but every time I go onto the app it crashes and comes up with 'No Text Channels'. I have to uninstall and reinstall it at least 5 times a day, it isn't practical.	bug report
I can't chande my photo	feature request
I enjoy discord a lot, I am not very satisfied regarding to the userbase tho but at this point I do not think that it can be helped.	irrelevant information
New layout, clunky + I don't know where anything is. amount of bugs, a lot. For some reason, when I try to switch my audio output to speaker when I'm in a call, it just doesn't work. There is also a bug with the mic because it doesn't let me speak even when I turn the noise stuff off. What's the point of discord if you can't even talk with friends in a voice call? There's even a bug with video sharing. It doesnt finish uploading the file and it just stays there, stuck. absolutely outrageous.	bug report
I've been using discord since it started. However the new update for the App has made loading much slower.	bug report
bring back old ui. new ui is a steaming pile of garbage. the only thing good about it is the amoled mode.	feature request
Forcefully updated my mobile version massively reducing quality of life by implementing the worst layout ever, downgraded to a significantly more tedious and ineffective layout. Reconsider	feature request
Stop changing the UI. It runs and looks like trash.	feature request
The new UI has brought a whole host of issues with it. Viewing large images has issues, users in calls can disconnect without notice, being able to see server members is now much harder, and occasionally names in DMs don't load properly, seeing statuses is nigh impossible, and you can't select loudspeaker or internal speaker prior to joining a call. Just made everything worse, all for a supposed visual upgrade (which to be honest, didn't even provide that).	bug report
The new update messed things up. Too many bugs. Hate it. The interface is nice and all but seriously, pls do something with the bugs. Its annoying. And the old features of being able to see who's online is much better. Now discord feels like any other chatting app. Devolving. At least keep some of your uniqueness!	feature request
New update is bum	irrelevant information

A bit of a learning curve when you get started but it's worth it, great call quality and features. A lot of features are behind a paywall and I understand nothing is free and bandwidth is expensive I just wish it wasn't all on a subscription or tier service I would just like to pay once and own it and be done with it , instead of the app for ever siphoning money out my wallet. Overall a good service except for the subscription pay walls and the initial learning curve.	feature request
I don't know why some of the servers got remove even tho im not ban in that server and when i search it there are some people that have the sam problem they call it bug ban but idk so just asking in here	bug report
Can't join voice chat through this app on mobile. Will not connect or authenticate in any network	bug report
Could be quicker to navigate around, and the emojis are hideos. Just let me use the standard Android ones pls.	feature request
Whenever on call SOMEONE'S MIC DOESNT WORK. Can be fine one minute- then just stops, its happened to me personaly and it is stressful. You could have amazing wifi conection, and triple check ypur blootooth or speaker, and it still cuts out.	bug report
it was smooth in the beginning, now its just laggy. images and videos wont send, trying to check servers is also laggy, its crashing more than the older version and sometimes i wont even get notifications that someone messaged me, or messages are extremely delayed from when they were originally sent.	bug report
Discord is pretty good but i regret using it because eventually it has ruined my life.	irrelevant information
Sometimes video calls break. Other than that, best app for teams, groups, forums, gamers and people who are apart in general.	bug report
The app in general is great, but if you happen to get your account disabled don't except for support to answer you. I've sent two requests and in a month nothing happened, i got an answer but they completely ignored my appeal even if I'm soon 18. Not to mention I had the bot answer to me lastly, when i needed a person.	irrelevant information
Discord being my main way of communication, it's starting to be annoying. Honestly, the new update is more buggy. I don't get it, but if I send a message in a group and move to another channel, the same channel chat keeps popping up. which, in turn, makes me have to close and reopen the app. It's getting frustrating.	bug report
Not reciving any verification code	bug report
So many hacker	irrelevant information
The new ui is total garbage	feature request
New ui sucks, found a bug after using the app with latest update in less than 5 minutes.	feature request
Gets progressively less intuitive to use. Latest update feels like it's actively trying to make it as hard as possible to navigate and communicate with people. If there weren't ways to rollback these updates I'd have deleted this abhorrent mess of an app off my phone.	feature request
I would love it, if you wouldn't put up so much unasked for stuff that bugs around since for 1,5 years now! Now it's the profile template or what it's called. It's too smol and on the lower half. Also, the format makes it look like japanese text without their letters. Top to bottom!	irrelevant information
Discord you need to remove the verify thing, I just made my 4th account and I need to verify again. Please remove it, I won't be able to chat with my classmates/friends again and the new update a little bit annoys me. Please fix the problem.	feature request
WAS The standard. 2023 Update - I'm downgrading to 4 stars due to some disturbing trends to try and reduce anonymity by the user name policy change. A small step, but a noticable one that was unnecessary.	irrelevant information

Great app new ui I don't like as much because it's hard to find stuff otherwise it is perfect	feature request
Still not used to the new updates. Prefer some of the old features better.	irrelevant information
EDIT (after dev's reply): What I wrote here has been true for years, I don't think beta will help, but thx for the contact info. Sometimes (can't say usually) it works, but I hate one thing the most: very often, I get a new message notif. but when I tap it, the app opens and the conversation's not refreshed (and it doesn't get refreshed for a looong time) so I can't actualy read the msg. This also happens sometimes randomly and I need to kill the app and restart it to see the refreshed log.	bug report
The new ui is just god awful	feature request
Very informative, but can't post pictures anymore	bug report
The new layout is horrible, i liked the old one. Camt even open the online user lists on a server anymore....	feature request
Like the app, but I found the latest update to be unnecessary in regards to seeing the member list for the server. It was fine before, but I find the new update to be silly when it comes to opening the member list. I preferred swiping over to open the list over pressing the channel tab to see the list. Please consider reverting at least that change since I have no other issues with the latest update. Now when try to swipe to check the server member list it makes me opt to reply to a user.	feature request
The office all the same features as the computer version, but it's not as intuitive. And there are a lot of extra clicks to make calls or jump between threads	feature request
New Update won't let us see how many notifications we get from one dm, instead opting for just telling you that you got a notification instead.	feature request
Cant live without it	irrelevant information
Do I even need to say anything? Just read literally any of the reviews below this one and watch discord respond with a cookie cutter copy paste response as an added slap in the face. They are so hopelessly in denial about this new UI update, too.	irrelevant information
Overall, I love the app, don't know what I'd do without it, although a huge issue I've noticed is when changing the positions of channels and roles 2 infuriating bugs can occur. When moving a channel or role it can put it higher than where you actually put it, so far up at times it's off the screen, and after you save it has a chance to shuffle the entite list, which means I have to manually put everything back where it belongs, it's annoying, it's time consuming, and it's happened for too long.	bug report
Don't like the new way discord mods are selling usernames but other than that it's cool.	irrelevant information
Give us the option to revert back to the old layout	feature request
Good product but the new layout is unintuitive Edit: updated review to two stars, channels aren't refreshing properly or the wrong channel is being shown when posting messages or accessing via notifications	bug report
It does everything I want to thanks for making discord I probably couldn't live without it	irrelevant information
Yall need to work on getting the z fold to work right. The height-ways one doesn't let me send, the button isn't in frame.	bug report
I love the app, it's very handy to be able to communicate with everyone, but one thing I don't like since the update is I can't see who is online in my server. I used to be able to see a list of members and who was online on the side of the server, but now to see the members I have to go to settings and see them through there. It's so annoying especially since I can't see who's online anymore. Idk maybe it's just me and it's got nothing to do with the update but please let me know. I use android	feature request
I've been using Discord for years with no issue. These recent mobile updates have been pretty bad, though. The newest update is bugged so that whenever I open the app, it gets stuck on one channel I was in and won't show me anything else. It won't even display new messages sent in that channel. I can click on different channels and send messages on them, I just can't see what I'm replying to or what I'm even typing. It also keeps showing me an ad for Nitro EVERY time I open the app.	bug report
Nothing but issues since the update, freezes, blank screens, notifications don't work, really disappointed, it was fine before	bug report
"New mobile user interface is awful and more difficult to navigate. I don't typically struggle with a couple buttons getting moved around here or there, but there are whole functions and menu navigations that are simply no longer intuitive and it makes no sense the way they've been rearranged. You've taken all the silverware out of the kitchen, put them in the bathroom drawer instead, then told me you ""improved"" things and that if I have any struggles with these changes I just need to adapt..."	feature request
discord rlly needs to fix the no audio output on mobile , overall other things are fine	bug report
"This is the worst update E V E R. Everything is broken, can't send images, keeps greying out, stuff not loading, features are missing and you dare to keep asking more money on top of absurd Nitro pricing? ""HEY VISIT THE STORE, check out these new cosmetics, new feature to Nitro""... Maybe this was warranted if you didn't release broken updates, add features you have to backpedal on (emoji and sticker packs...) and then make it a Nitro exclusive feature before removing them entirely. Do better."	bug report
Good but in my phone ( Honor 8 ) the app crashes when i try to read any forum's channel post ( the very first messages ), i would like to see this bug fixed soon <3	bug report
Previous versions are better because that doesn't take time for loading But know it takes minimum 2 minutes for loading	bug report
The app was good, but now it keeps crashing and bugging out, sometimes I can't type messages, sometimes the send button dissapears and sometimes I can't move from DMs to servers because the app crashes.	bug report

One of the best If not the Best application for chatting	irrelevant information
Before I was told discord fo kids and Game but, I decided to tryout Now I can't live with channel I have .Thank you	irrelevant information
EDIT: have contacted support, pending review Just wanted to flag that the app has recently had a bunch of issues which seem to be getting worse, including: not updating or syncing messages, taking ages to load images in especially when you open them up (on any network), unwanted new features being persistent with popping up. I'm worried about a once very streamlined app becoming bloated.	bug report
This new update is not optimal. the mobile version seems to be getting worse and worse with every update. first was the UI where it moved messages into being its own tab at the bottom of the screen instead of being with the server listing. along with that, seeing whos online by swiping left is now replaced with replying which is annoying. and now i cant send images whatsoever without receiving an error. truly a mistake and must be fixed.	feature request
This app is fairly good	irrelevant information
Hard to use as a beginner but it's okay	irrelevant information
Newest update no longer supports my official sansung buds pro 2 bluetooth earbuds in a call, audio for the call begins then immediately redirects to phone speaker despite bluetooth call setting chosen. Tried on both 1.5 and 1.6 BT dev framework	bug report
i absolutely adore discord and use it 24/7 to chat with friends and my bf. the new layout though is NOT it. its confusing and makes moving around from chat to chat a lot slower, i can see myself becoming less active and less inclined to financially support the app because of this. please either change it back or come up with something better, this layout aint good!!	feature request
Can you ugrade discord to make it easier I can't even log my account when my account discord got disabled.	irrelevant information

hi,discord is getting hacked it always spam steam links 1000 times even my friends	bug report
It never connects my headphones. I've tried everything to fix it, but nothing works.	bug report
Horrible new mobile UI that's completely unintuitive and takes longer to move between chats and servers than ever before. How anyone thought this was a good idea is unimaginable, it's an objective downgrade compared to what we had before, which was essentially a mobile version of the desktop application. Calls and watching Streams are worse than ever, too. This new UI overhaul only serves to make the experience worse for both old and new users and is one of the worst decisions Discord ever made.	feature request
Let us apply for Nitro Classic/Boost Credit in Mobile.	irrelevant information
Changed the ui for whatever reason. It is immensely uncomfortable compared to any previous ui and is not even close to the desktop ui. Wouldn't be a big deal if we could just have an option for this layout but no	feature request

How did they make the app so bad? It used to work perfectly, but this new Ui update makes everything slow and break 90% of the time.	feature request
The new UI update is very bad. It takes long to navigate between servers and dms. Please bring back the old one where its just the same as on desktop...	feature request
It is a very good app for texts and calling	irrelevant information
The new UI is clunky and unintuitive. It is a downgrade over the previous UI in every possible way. Needing more motions to navigate between different sections is a strange design choice when the previous UI was much more streamlined. Very disappointing.	feature request
Give us the old UI.	feature request
New UI is atrocious and it won't let me put it on external storage. Terrible app; on the same trajectory as skype was before everyone stopped using it.	feature request
New update made the UI queer and lost the push to talk button at the bottom. Can't even get it to stay on the voice channel page. Also: being on a call destroys the audio quality of any other app trying to play audio so it sounds like AM radio.	bug report
Excellent app to coordinate with friends, alliances.. etc.	irrelevant information
Was better before the UI update. Don't really care about it because it's not that bad but the app is much slower, even on a brand new phone, AND let's not forget the fact discord is ignoring the majority of their audience and doesn't care about any of their complaints despite them being very abundant!	irrelevant information
its a good app but its so slow and vc doesn't work	bug report
"Remember when all Discord had was ""not Skype"" and we all switched over that? I'm waiting for a compelling ""not Discord"" to appear."	irrelevant information
Great app but some glitches still there are not sending messages server crashes and even laggy for me	bug report
Great app for social usability depending upon individual criteria.	irrelevant information
Awful voice quality in app sounds like the conversation is going on underwater, also call and communication mode is removed which fixed the audio quality somehow. It works well on the browser in desktop mode	bug report
Tbh I like discord alot I use it everyday but the nitro is not useful just for a moving pfp n banner, no one else uses it for other reasons. I think moving pfp should be free and the others nitro.	feature request
5 stars but they removed nitro classic :(. Also no ads in the app but not sure if cos I have nitro, also memes and friends and... Wait, I have no friends :(	irrelevant information
I despise this new layout. Plus it gets buggy and crashes when I have it in the background.	bug report
Reply is not good	irrelevant information
Well I've had discord for awhile I think it's a great app to text people and make new friends but I gave it a lower star rating only because I find the new look of the app to be um a bit hard to understand and there's so much going on that it makes it a bit buggy maybe I just liked the old one better since it was a lot like the PC version which is the one I mainly use. Other than that it's a great app.	feature request
The new update to the app is so confusing already. The overall app is good, but now with this new update I find it harder to navigate things, even though the update is supposed to help with that (I'm guessing anyways.) In my opinion, this is not a great update. As I mentioned, it's confusing and it's even bad to look at. The app is great though.	feature request
Now its better	irrelevant information

I've been using this app since the end of 2018, and it was wonderful. The new update, however, is awful. The UI is not so great. Clicking notifications doesn't take you where you need to be. I have to also close the app constantly to get it to work. It's not a bad app, but I do not enjoy it as much at all. They tried to fix something that was already perfect, and ended up making it bad.	bug report
Go to use just to talk to your friends and to catch up with your friends	irrelevant information
I loved this app so much, I used it to play games with friends. Used it for years. Whoever they assigned to make it look disgusting should be fired. Discord was awesome because the set up was unique. They ruined it trying to make it look like other social media apps. Why would you ruin something that was just fine? I tried bypassing the update until it was forcefully updated because I hated the way my friends apps now looked. It sucks. Congrats Discord.	irrelevant information
Discord has no doubt provided and facilitated an excellented environment for community building with countless, diverse features. However, one of the most fundamental elements of a communication application that is chat, doesn't function properly in the discord channels. While in mid of a conversation in a discord channel, with each new message sent, I have faced the chat scrolling many messages upwards automatically. This has deterred me from having a satisfactory conversation on Mobile.	bug report
This new update is absolutely disgusting, what were you thinking?! If you are going to keep with this no good palette and the fact that I can't just swipe from the right to the left to see the members, this app just became many times worse and harder to handle. Jesus Christ.	feature request
App is very good but when use it my internet is some slow that now much issues	bug report
PLEASE GET BACK THE OLD LAYOUT THIS IS JUST BAD AND LAGGY	feature request
The last update added a few huge problems for mobile users. The worst for me was changing the call volume system without updating the troubleshooting. It does not default to speaker anymore and does not show the option to set it to speaker. It is hidden through an icon and not mentioned in the app settings. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if the troubleshooting guide told us about it. Just, please stop making this worse.	bug report

The app itself works for the most part but far too often my friends and I have issues with the app even connecting. It'll be stuck on Connecting even with stable internet. Randomly midcall someone will start sounding like a robot and we've had to just start making normal phone calls again. I've been using the app for some years on multiple phones and the issues with the discord app have only become more common. Vc option is questionable but posting, download, upload, text all works well :)	bug report

I love the new update. It's just amazing after almost a decade of having a messy and outdated interface compared to the desktop counterpart.	feature request
A good communication app, but the new UI sucks and theres no signs of them going back. Not to mention it is extremely buggy and overall very unintuitive. Used to be my favorite app for talking to friends, but I'm liking it less every day. Constant new useless paid (and free) features are relentlessly over cluttering the app. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be using discord if this becomes a constant pattern.	feature request
Amazing app. My only issue is that sometimes discord just straight up refuses to send me notifications for dms. It's at the point I don't even get them anymore and I use discord to mainly dm my friends.	bug report
i love this app thank u very much may allah bless u	irrelevant information
The app crashes constantly. The video player stops working, the interface somehow merges in with the phone interface (User names and channel names merging with the phones notification panel somehow??), the app crashes when you try to send something from a 3rd party app. It's a complete mess and it makes me furious Discord devs would rather release avatar frames and other useless cosmetics for a seperate price (what are we even paying Nitro subscription for?)	bug report

Bad, every review I've given about any problems since being a Discord user back around 2016 wasn't replied to and there's one now where some of us can't see nickname colours which we reported last year. Still seen no advice by discord support on how to properly sort the issue out. Happened on iPhone mini 13 and the S21 Ultra and now the Poco M4 Pro. Fine for the first week of downloading onto a new phone then something happens and nicknames look very bland and I have got developer settings on...	bug report
I liked this app cause its different and cause how it looks,, but the new update SUCKS and theres so many bugs!!! We want old discord back, atleast make an option to change it back or atleast fix the bugs.	feature request
What happened?!? The app was great, but now it is complete trash that is unusable. Every time I try to go somewhere, it either freezes or crashes.	bug report
It's a great but the issue I been having is whenever I try getting in it sometimes glitch to the side not letting me see what people is saying. Sometimes discord would just glitch me out of the channels I'm already in.	bug report

the mobile version is so laggy its unbearable, editing my profile is hard, sometimes it just crashes etc. just annoying tbh bc i love discord	bug report
New UI is an actual eyesore. Whoever made it should genuinely be fired.	feature request
The new UI is very annoying	feature request
Most of the time Discord works really well for me! It's great and it's my main way of talking to people. Lately though it's been really buggy with me on my phone. Closing my keyboard mid message, kicking me from calls for seemingly no reason, my camera not turning off after I turn it back on. I'm not sure if it's my phone or Discord.	bug report
Great when I'm away and I can't bring my laptop. Has nearly all the same features as the desktop version and the quality is great. And for a calling app. This does have alot of Easter eggs ! Only problem is that server management is difficult to use in the mobile version but other than that I have almost 0 complaints about this app	irrelevant information
I don't recieve notifications from discord most of the time despite having the settings set for me to recieve those	bug report
I've been using discord for over 5 years now and up until the past month its been the best place for me to communicate and interact with more people but after this new mobile layout was released mobile discord has become so awful its practically unusable. there are so many bugs and glitches that force me to close and reopen the app multiple times to get it to work, I have to constantly leave and rejoin calls and my vc setting keep getting reset randomly as well. I just want the option to go back	bug report

The new update is worst thing that happened to discord, new doesn't mean better, idea might have been good but the implementation was made by a an incompetent programmer. The one who said it's perfect has to make an reality check. Bugs, UI MESS, lags, things out of place, revamped this and that, guys for what are you getting your +100k salary??? Big F-	bug report
Super laggy since the new update	bug report
Man, wherever I open the app it keeps getting crashed , I just wanna tell the developers to do something about this	bug report
The new mobile UI is absolute dogwater.	feature request
It's a fun easy way to talk to your friends and the servers make it easy to meet new people and with all the features it's easily my top communication app there are some really weird people	irrelevant information
buggy as hell rn icon change was mid	bug report
What did you do the ui it used to work so well before now I can't see which all of my friends are online the member list in each channel is now hard to see you gotta do more steps these were useful features I hope you can give an option to those who want it back	feature request
ok guys idk what they messed up with the new ui update but ever since that this app is literally unusable like it breaks and glitches more than it doesnt this is genuinely embarrassing for such a big company maybe like revert it to how was before and work from that idfk	bug report
I can get over the new UI and changes with how you get around the app, but there have been so many bugs that require me to restart discord. Sometimes if I just exit the app for the moment and return to it, it completely restarts as if it's been idle for a while. This app is a complete mess and an insult to someone who pays for your Nitro service.	bug report
i do not like the new ui update, it is very counterintuitive and clunky. i think it's very unprofessional that you wouldn't give us at least the option to toggle into the new or the old ui, there's literally no need to force our hand like this. i will be unsubscribing from nitro	feature request
Its the best social media but its not as good as it was	irrelevant information

Discord, you keep making your app worse and worse. This new layout gotta go, it sucks.	feature request
My mic sometimes doesn't work why	bug report
I'm gonna be honest with the new UI, so far I prefer the old one due to its simplicity and easy to navigate from servers to DMs, however from the new one so far: it kind of complicated my way to navigate and see messages... it was very unexpected to see it coming in this update.	feature request
It's terrible since the UI change. Unintuitive and got rid of many useful features. Also, it looks bad.	feature request
I really love this app but sometimes when I try calling someone it doesn't let them talk like I've been trying to call my bf but he picks up and it says he muted and can't hear me it's also really annoying that you can only send up to ten pictures at a time and when it try's to send it gets really laggy I hope u can fix the calling problem. But otherwise I really like this app	bug report
Ever since the last update the app has been really slow.	irrelevant information
PLEASE INCREASE THE GROUPCHAT MEMBER LIMIT 10 is too little, wayyy too little who decided it should be 10 and no more anyways like fr and no u cannot just make a server, groupchats made into servers are an objectively bad idea it will die and become inactive within two and a half days im telling u this rn. the energy, the vibe of a groupchat is way different from a server just increase the limit dawg im begging you	feature request
Having constant problems with discord failing to properly switch channels and send my messages. To fix, I must clear cache. Deleting data didn't fix. I'm trying a fresh install now. C'mon & fix, discord!	bug report

Audio quality for mobile has gone to hell people can't hear me and or can't hear me clearly	bug report
I've just updated the app this morning, and I really don't like new ui. It's like tap more than usual. And got the feeling the app using more processing and battery, on my s23. Prefer the previous version.	feature request
Well good app been using it for years been in the latest update whwn ever i open it it gives me connecting and doesnt connect doesn't show anything o dont use vpn nor anything and iy it never happened to me before	bug report
AMOLED stopped working. I've tried redownloading the app, and restarting my phone. In the end nothing works. Other than that, the app is amazing.	bug report
After using it for a while, I really dislike the new layout. It makes it difficult to use. Also, the search feature is completely broken, forcing the keyboard to stay open, hiding search results. It's also harder to switch between servers and direct messages. Bad app, regret updating.	feature request
It's difficult to learn and the quality is seems inconsistent. Other than that I enjoy the changes they make to the program. I do wish the loaded photograph would look like the photo that is uploaded. Not exactly of course but closer to the photograph	feature request
In its current state the app is formatted terribly. Use the browser version instead	feature request
It's nice to use and easy to talk with friends.	irrelevant information

Okay, I really HATE this new update. Everything of the new layout and look is gross and disgusting. It's messed up EVERYTHING	feature request
App is no longer sending notifications on mobile. I double checked all my settings and it definitely should be, and was in the past, but no longer is. I moved a lot of chats to discord specifically because it was better at keeping me in the loop on mobile and now that's broken.	bug report
"really horrible UI update, made even worse by a ""get over it lol"" stance on discord's part - and they even had the gall to start asking for reviews to offset the bad ones"	feature request
New update is awful and ruined the perfect layout it previously had. Switching from servers to messages is a pain	feature request
"LOVED the app.. but now the new update change to the ""user experience"" is horrible, no one uses Discord Mobile before the Desktop app, now I'm swiping left and it's replying to chats? The whole experience is ruined and quite frankly it's cluttered, revert the change, it was hassle free to look at chats and servers, see what my friends are up to, now it's like a messaging app, but a bad one.. Discord was for gamers..?"	feature request
Don't like new update...why remove search bar from bottom side ?	feature request
Would like a Back button as on the website version.	feature request
It's definitely getting better but the new uploading indicator is super broken, the indicator says its uploading on the client yet on the server its already been uploaded. And that's the thing, every new implementation on this app does not work as it should be. I love the new ideas Discord's implementing but they always miss on the execution. Please fix the broken video player, please fix the ui because it becomes a small sliver at times, and please listen to the non-existent testers.	bug report

I use discord everyday but since my handset did an update the app constantly stops responding and shuts down this issue has been going on for a while now and still not been resolved	bug report
I just updated discord and found out you cant revert to the old layout, why would they remove this feature this new layout is laggy and worse than the old one, please add back the option to revert to the old layout.	feature request
The new UI sucks, it hides the search function behind 2 layers of menu, it makes returning to the message from search a pain, it broke search functionality, it STILL DOESN'T AVOID ACCIDENTAL CALLS, it's now IMPOSSIBLE TO UPLOAD PICTURES MADE IN APP bc it just reloads the list of messages instead of staying in the most recent discussion. Discord is enshittification and more intrusive nitro bs too	bug report
Update made the user experience much worse. My eyes are bleeding and people who I never talk to are on this stupid ribbon above my actual message history :(	irrelevant information
recently, it's been sending 1 message like 3 times. Idk why, but it's kind of annoying	bug report
My gods this app is awful. Please bring back the old design. I play games on discord that need really easy pinned message access, and search capabilities. Good blooming luck getting to either easily and getting what you want from it. Not only that it shows *one* channel sometimes, doesnt matter what channel Im actually in, it looks like one channel always. Usually the one the app opened in. It gained a star as its a reliable voice call system. Video needs cache clear sometimes.	feature request
"It works now. However I am not happy about some of the changes. Typing ""from:"" and other keywords no longer seems to work, they need to be accessed from the filter list."	feature request
Its ok but when i to open a account it say not right now what do you mean not right now? I tried to do it again but it kept on saying not right now. I wanna this game fixed in 3 days	bug report
I've been using discord for about 7-8 years now. I forgot exactly how long, but it's been a while. It was really good, loved it. But now they're changing permissions with with privacy on your device and pushing notifications that just aren't needed. Why do I need to get notified about what's being talked about and not be able to turn it off? Why is it collecting more of my data? People started using it so much because it wasn't like all the other social media apps. Now they're copying Facebook.	feature request
"After updating it today, I was stuck in connecting purgatory and decided to unistall and reinstall the app, DO NOT DO THIS. I can't log into either of my accounts as I get ""500: Internal server error"", please fix this Discord. Edit: An hr later and I can log in, so I'll bump it up to three stars."	bug report
Sometimes this app close by itself and automatically disconnected from the server	bug report
One of the best app	irrelevant information
This app has alot of capabilities of chatting with your friends, its much better then WhatsApp. And you have the ability of joining multiple servers regarding about gaming and stuff. One downside is that the limitations of using the app really isn't great. In order to use emojis from certain servers, you have to pay to get them. Which is fair in order for them to get money. Kinda disappointed.	feature request
I've been using this app from 3 or 4 months. Now I think this app is so useful. Anyways thanks for making this app.	irrelevant information
[Moblie/app version] I'm not sure if it's just an update but recently I've been having problems with reacting to msgs/bots.

Trying the screen share on a phone is easy if and when you have the same devices. Trying to screen share from Android Samsuge to Apple iPhone is pretty much impossible without audio or framerates cutting out.	feature request
The new UI is janky and unituitive. Separating features, making old features harder to access, and making navigation an actual chore to do. Leaving and entering a chat or clicking on a notification will send you way above in the chat, and loading times take noticably longer than before the UI update.	feature request
New update is so bad, literally embarrassing for you guys for thinking this was a good idea	irrelevant information

Ok the apps been pretty good but I'm having problems rn,so this happened on my tablet but I fixed it by disconnecting my headphones. So it's not letting me hear or talk in calls even after updating the app and idk what to do because I tried settings and nothing worked	bug report
"I'm having constant camera freeze on my end seeing others videos even when my internet connection is stable and strong. Realised the video option have all disappeared!

This update sucks as it won't even let me open up the app.. Please fix this as soon as possible.	bug report
Its decent, things used to be so simple but I feel the app has just gotten more complicated and money driven as of recent. Its fine to promote but it just feels a tad over done. Otherwise voice and video calls are great. Quality is dependant on your connection.	irrelevant information
Discord mobile is still forced in the new view, riddled with bugs forcing you to regularly restart the app, and it's overall just worse than when it was. I don't care if it was basically a direct port of the PC version, I don't care if the new mobile version technically can work better or be more ergonomical or something, we liked it and it worked. I still love you discord, but why would you force the mobile view???	bug report
Been a discord user since 2016. Been a long time since ive had mobile app issues. Lately the app doesnt show me that ive sent a message when i click send	bug report

"new layout is absolutely vile. makes it extremely hard to see new messages compared to before and makes it look like a twitter clone somehow. horrid edit: going like ""oh we understand change is difficult :("" is disingenuous because you don't have to change it. you don't have to make your app significantly harder to navigate. making your app actively difficult to use is not going to make people want to use it. also making it so that you can't switch the old layout back on is also awful."	feature request

"The best part of Discord was the fact that you could switch between the desktop and the mobile version and keep a sense of familiarity. This mobile update has thrown that out the window. The font sizing is now horrible for most users. The forced new ""dark"" mode has really hurt people with sensitive eyes because it's blue and darker, not the original dark/medium gray. As someone who lives on familiarity (non-neurotypical), this has caused a great deal of stress. It's just not very functional."	feature request
They took a good thing, and made it 9500% WORSE. BRING BACK OLD UI AND NOT THIS MESS!	feature request
"At least when the gaming community was dependent on using Skype and functioned through apps similar to Skype, apps like such mentioned actually came through and delivered with the basic ""calling"" function or ""group chat"" function. Discord's management and processing ""looks"" purposefly careless with how they barely address criticism and critique with merit, validity, and a genuine response. Quick to take hoards of money & slow to make much happen or address issues is laziness if you ask me."	irrelevant information
It's good, but I wish the scroll until the last message read is still an optional feature because my fingers is tired from pressing the new message notifications over and over again	feature request
Just, why did you all have to change the UI, it's painful to look at and annoying. The previous UI was completely fine there was nothing wrong at all	feature request
Seriously? I directly messaged some people, and I have to verify? Sure, I'd do that. If my password and e-mail weren't invalid every single time I'd try to verify. Zero stars if I could.	feature request
A lot of basic stuff is nitro blocked. Also, day 169 of waiting for them to add a status block feature, theres just statuses I dont want some people/some servers to know about, please im begging you to add this feature.	feature request
it's getting better...keep the app easy and simple to use...kids friendly	irrelevant information
Lots of bugs fixed, now just bad design. Terrible UX. New UI adds 1~2 more distant clicks to frequent actions. It's painfully slow in more ways than one: it's laggy too. They broke existing gestures (and my muscle memory) to add swipe-to-reply instead of doing something sensible like double tapping a message. They had a cohesive UX and design language between devices that everyone loved, and just **** all over it for no good reason. It seems to be becoming a pattern...	feature request

You guys SERIOUSLY need to fix your notification system, or perhaps even rebuild it. There's no way Discord notifications should constantly break down or not show up at all. I love using Discord but you really need to focus on bugs rather than new features.	bug report

Since the most recent update to discord, apart from the unwanted UI changes. It's caused an issue with chat channels through my Xbox and can no longer access the voice channels, regardless of how many times I un-link and re-link the account. I have no issues with the mobile app itself, but the update has caused a lot of issues with connectivity to my Xbox and it's fairly annoying because I use those channels to chat very frequently with friends playing through other gaming platforms.	bug report

Sometimes all audio just outright doesn't work, even with all permissions on, and every setting messed with. That means the microphone doesn't register, and you can't hear anyone else in a call. It's just way too inconsistent. Another thing, sometimes images will refuse to display properly - you'll see like 1/3 of the image from the left side, and videos will also not play correctly - until you restart the app completely. ~Galaxy S22 Ultra	bug report

Although it can be for 13+, there are nasty people on there. If you are 13+ and think you are mature enough and can handle people, just be safe. I'm saying this as an 11-year-old. I just hope that whoever goes on here stays safe and doesn't experience what I did. If you are under 13 like me and just go on there to make friends, try to mostly look for relaxed/chill servers. I know not a lot of people will see this, but.. just be safe, please.	irrelevant information

discord works very poorly on mobile. frequent bugs that prevent you from seeing channels, videos, even just opening a channel with too many gifs can crash your app. I feel really badly about rating it like this, but every update seems counter intuitive, getting closer to a 'basic' texting app, even though it wants to keep making over 70% of features that are introduced paid for. if you could just buy it once, then maybe that'd work, but for now it just seems like a battle pass to use a chat app.	bug report
I'm a user since 2017 and nitro subscriber. It should be apparent enough through other reviews that the new UI is absolutely horrendous compared to the old one. It's buggy and made useful features a pain to get to. Either revert the UI or fix it. Even better would be making it customizable. Honestly my friend group is all on the brink of changing apps.	feature request
"I've been using Discord since 2016 and I'm no stranger to change. I don't need my platform to look the same way forever, so long as the changes made feel justified. Unfortunately, Discord is going the ""bottlenecking"" route of mobile app development where they're going to continue to put in ""enhancements"" that do nothing but eat ram and slow down the platform. Roll it back to the old UI that isn't even that different from what you ""upgraded"" it to, and don't link me that worthless ""help"" article"	feature request
Everything was fine until the update now I don't get the notifications anymore	bug report

the new layout it's just bad	feature request
The audio for voice calls keeps cutting out please help!	bug report
The new UI is interesting but I'd prefer to go back on the old one. Weird bug on messages when I reopen the app, the messages are the same, on different channels and servers and I have to quit/reopen the app again to fix it until the next time	bug report
New update broke sending images and the new UI is terrible	feature request
Great application, good for almost any form of communication, only issue I have is they terminated my original account falsely with no evidence.	irrelevant information
The performance tanked with the latest update, basically every feature is broken now.	irrelevant information
Its good for what its for, idk what else you expect me to say. Every few weeks i have to fix the moderator settings or delete and redownload because it locks up to where you can't access the rooms. Other than that its ok i guess.	bug report
The app has been crashing a lot on phone and now it finally stopped working... And still hasn't started after 40 minutes. I hope this big gets fixed as I lost a lot of time gated assignments and work.	bug report
Sometimes video wont play, or only play for the first few seconds.	bug report
In my view, Discord's quality has been declining significantly over the past few years. Ever since they transitioned to a new codebase, the mobile app has been plagued with persistent bugs, some of which remain unfixed, despite being known for at least a year. It appears that Discord prioritizes profit, as evidenced by their $11 charge for a profile effect, which I find absurd. Moreover, many desirable features are restricted behind a Nitro paywall. Voice messages are in awful quality.	bug report
Was fine, new update is trash. Switching between servers and dm's lags, viewing images bugs out, swiping left to see members in a channel is gone, it's just trash.	bug report
New update ui is awful	feature request
I want to use previous version. This update made it like I'm using 2g network and 10 year older smartphone. Not even opening many times....why !?	bug report

"This app is great honsetly, ive made tons of friends and stuff. I have used this app for almost 2 year now and i havent had much of a probelm. But i have a HUGE problem, for some reason, whenever im trying to talk to a friend it shows the usual ""connecting"" thing. The problem? i have perfectly normal internet. I have tried evrrything to try and fix it. I have even uninstalled reinstalled it. It still isnt being fixed. I havent been able to talk with my friends for over a week. Please fix this!"	bug report
Latest update has been terrible. App functionality is becoming worse and worse.	irrelevant information
Newest update ruined my app experience. It's very counterintuitive to navigate and frustrating to use.	feature request
Been having major video issues for the past few months. I hangout with a group of friends every night, and the video always freezes or goes pixilated.	bug report
I loved this app prior the the update. Told several people to download it and start using it at it was infinitely more reliable and user friendly than some other messaging apps. Now it's hot garbage. It takes forever to connect to any type of service, wifi or cellular, it won't register that you sent a reply, then suddenly you've sent the same thing 3 times. So unfortunate. Please fix it or go back to what it used to be.	bug report
I've been a discord user since 2015 and recently the mobile app is in the worst shape I can remember. Missing notifications, problems switching between channels (requiring hard reset) problems seeing your own messages in a current channel (also requiring a hard reset) hey but isn't it fun that they are spending time celebrating their 'birthday'? Discord seems to relish making features nobody needs while ignoring the pleas for features everyone is asking for. Time to go back to teamspeak!	bug report
Completely unusable app. The interface is laggy and the application is unstable.	bug report
I absolutely love this new separation of the Servers and Messeges as tabs!	irrelevant information

it's a good app for friends and streams but whenever it comes to calling with bluetooth earbuds, no matter what i do to fix the problem, the call won't connect to my earbuds without me restarting my whole phone, which is super annoying and it makes me want to delete the app as a whole after a while	bug report

I use an old version and I'm keeping it that way as I've seen that the latest one is terrible. why change the layout and add more clicks/taps... you're a messaging platform, keep it simple	feature request
New update is terrible. Least give us a option to keep the old version.	feature request
Its been many months, I got used to the new update but man how did it become so laggy?! It is almost unbearable and inconvenient. I dont know which one of you decided to suggest this update but we wanna go back!	bug report
New version of this is too buggy	irrelevant information
The only thing the app is good for nowadays is push notifications, the app is a bloated unoptimized mess that barely runs well on a mid range device, and low end devices have a better shot running this on their browsers in desktop mode. The (new) UI that they forced on everyone is horrendous, especially egregious that they'd do this when they still had work to do on the previous ui (certain server mngmt menus would be so buggy). I regret keeping my nitro subscription for so long.	feature request
The app keeps crashing when I send media files	bug report
Pictures continue to keep turning blank when I zoom into them. Sometimes the app crashes unexpectedly, and forces me to leave my calls by kicking me out entirely. I've also had problems where videos don't play, or freeze randomly. Not buffering, but lowkey freezing. I don't care much for the new layout either. The old one was more navigational, this one is just more overwhelming and hard to navigate.	bug report
But now I can't even log in or make a new acc bc my old acc had my email so if I used the same email it would say it already resister so I can't do anything	irrelevant information
Too different from PC version, not a fan of the mobile update.	irrelevant information
It's so nice that Discord cares absolutely nothing for it's disabled users, and then doubles down by ignoring all feedback. I've never suggested this before, but I honestly think this app should be removed from playstore until it becomes more user friendly.	irrelevant information
Free and allows people to connect WAY easier than Zoom. It can be a bit frustrating to navigate at first, though. Also, unless someone sends an invite to a group, finding new ones is next to impossible. At least, that's been my experience.	irrelevant information
New ui isn't good, members list being pushed to a separate menu instead of swipe (which now sets you to reply to a message) is annoying. And that and the recent issue of attachments being broken, this ui is a mess and brought new messes to the table.	feature request
Pretty cool app.	irrelevant information
I used to love it before the update	irrelevant information
Suddenly cannot send media	bug report
It won't let me send images or videos I have saved, but it will let me send YouTube links, even for DMs. I don't know why it's doing this, but it's pissing me off. Please fix this.	bug report
Its an amazing app. It really is. Just the newest update that changes the whole layout was really bad. I think that many people agree that they should change the mobile layout back. That would bring my rating up to 5 stars	feature request
The app has become terrible. If it weren't for game events and 3 friends, i would never use this application! New UI is just the Worst!!	feature request
why do you complicate things, this new ui makes it harder to find who is online in a server, now instead of just swiping right, they have the reply swiping right, witch can be done pressing an holding the text your replying to. so we're the server list now, cause I have no idea. please go back to the way discord was before all this complication was added. You can see the 1 stars are starting to pile up can't you?	feature request
Too hard confusing to join	irrelevant information
Does not work on all phones, been added to a group and does not shows on the phone. Does not import all contacts. Changed phone and stopped working. No real support. I eould prefer to pay and have something tgat works or at least have support.	bug report

Not intuitive. Hard to get back to original screens. Not able to delete mistakes.	feature request
Not too sure about security nor privacy in this group format. Trouble finding messages within the feed	feature request
Causing nightmares to communicate with my team because messages will not send and notifications won't go off to notify people when messages are coming in. Used to love this app and helped me perform miracles with my team but the app is quickly becoming my biggest communication obstacle.	bug report
It usually works well but in one message group it wouldn't let me open it even though I'm a participant in it. In another group chat with some of the same people in it, it wouldn't send all of us some of the messages we were all supposed to see. This resulted in me not even finding out about a meeting of a group I'm a leader of till the day after the meeting happened.	bug report

Worked well for a while but suddenly stopped. I can no longer send or receive messages at all. I tried to reinstall the app and couldn't even get that to work!

I want to use it more but don't want to have to provide tech support to all the people I invite. Also it would be nice to have a maybe option or guests too.	feature request
It's a great way to keep people together and informed	irrelevant information

This app used to work so well and all of a sudden notifications never work and the messages don't load for anyone on time. It is incredibly frustrating when you are trying to run an organization relying on this app for communication.	bug report
After the last update I no longer get notifications......doesn't let me log on from my Note 8!!!!! Fix it!!!!!	bug report
Cant watch videos	bug report
The app does not send me any notifications regardless of how much I tinker with the settings to make it work. I've had to rely on changing the settings to send me SMS's for my chats so that I get an indicator of communication. This makes it very inconvenient for my use of Grouome where I need to reply to messages quick.	bug report
I would give this app a 5 because I have used it for so long. But, here lately, it will not send videos or gifs as messages. I have a Samsung Galaxy S5. Please fix.	bug report

I've been using this app since I think 2014 for messaging my band without wasting data on mass group texts, and it was amazing and helpful then, but recently my band hasn't been receiving notifications from the app when we try to schedule something or get opinions on something, and its come to a head, we've all made sure we've made sure our notifications were turned on and that the app is update to its latest version and we're still experiencing the same problem, so we're migrating to a new app.	bug report
Notifications will stop working randomly. I don't know why. I've checked the notification settings and they haven't changed. I've talked to friends and they say the same problem happens to them too.	bug report
Constant crashing, no notifications. Im even unable to change my name in a group chat. Not sure what update they did but this app is now useless.	bug report
Seems kinda buggy/laggy on my phone but other than that it's a nice app. Edit 6/6/2020: Took a star off because despite my experience in my previous review using my previous phone at least every feature worked. I went from a Moto X4 to now a OnePlus8 Pro and my bugginess/lagginess has been replaced with the inability to upload videos which is a way more serious offense in my opinion. Hope it gets fixed.	bug report
Works great. Reactions duplicate the message, which is unnecessary, but otherwise it works just like texting	feature request

Pretty good app. A little buggy. Every time I add someone, I get an error saying that the person was not added and yet they were. There is one feature that is really annoying. When you create a group, everyone has to respond back or they are kicked out of the group. In big group there are always people that just aren't big text people so they never respond but they still like to get the info. When they are dropped off, you have no idea until someone complains.	bug report

Useful app. I wish it had a few extra features like a signup for things like potlucks. Rating it 4 because of that and the emoji loading problems I had when I got rid of an old phone. It's not the new Google phone because it did the same thing on my new Samsung tablet. Other than that it's good.

Great app but requires a phone number. If it is a normal messaging app then there are better alternatives like WhatsApp and Wechat to name a few.

"Short and sweet: the latest update addressed missing or inconsistent for a number of users, including myself. This was not a short-term problem, but one that lasted for nigh two months before a solution. In the meantime, I missed out on communication regarding schoolwork and rent with roommates, hardly a ""reliable app"". Furthermore, there was no transparency from them, as they left us in the dark as to wonder where are our notifications. Overall, solid app when working, but when it doesn't, it's not fun, and Groupme never let me know why I didn't get messages for weeks from group members on a project."	bug report

I enjoy the app, but I wrote customer service twice now over a week ago with no response or resolution to my request... this is becoming a dealbreaker	irrelevant information

I love this app. We use it for our family of 12 and then I use it for family in another state. Keeps both groups connected and up to date on each other. Love love it !!! We use it to communicate what time and where we are all meeting for dinner, or at a function. No need to contact each person. Everyone can read it in group me. So convenient!!	irrelevant information
like the app, hate being asked to review it, then asked again even after reviewing it	irrelevant information
it's a great app for group messaging for a sports team just sometimes don't get all the notifications even tho i have it set up get them all. Once they fix that little bit then it'll be a 5 star app.	bug report
While it is a great forum to communicate I hate that I am unable to delete old messages. I don't want to archive them. I want to delete them.	feature request
Great app for communicating with a group. The worst part of it are their emojis. But that's minor	feature request
I've used groupme for awhile now and it used to be fine but this year suddenly I can't tag anyone in my messages and when other members post pictures half the time they never load for me, so I see just a blank spot. I've reached out and the team just gave up on my claim after a couple of things they told me to try didn't work	bug report
Routinely fails to load my groups and historic messages. Makes it impossible to participate in groups that use this app. Would not recommend. Try Signal instead	bug report

I don't like this app...would not be my choice	irrelevant information
It's a Group app seems legit.	irrelevant information
Functional. Lets you mute people. Add/remove people. It's great for after-school professionals (my experiences have all been in this realm)	irrelevant information
It's a great social app for groups to use when planning for big events or even just staying in touch. You can create calendar events that can be set to notify everyone when it's time to sign up or go. Creating polls for people to vote on the best choice of food for dinner or where to go out tomorrow is a great tool as well. The thing that could be better is the fact you cannot delete any chats. So if you have created a chat you don't need or want, you can't get rid of it.	feature request
I love the grouping controls.	irrelevant information
I've had a lot of problems lately with getting notifications from the chats. They are not on silent so I should be receiving then as they come. I've had to reinstall the app several times for it to work correctly only for me to still have problems. Not sure what the issue is.	bug report
Good app for group communication and events. Polls and images show up well. My one request is that my profile and account information (like the email and phone number my account is under) be a little more easily accessible. I have multiple emails and it is sometimes hard to remember which one my account is associated with when I have transferred GroupMe to a new device.	feature request
I cannot get into any group I am invited into.	bug report

Don't get notifications	bug report
Great for groups Update response: it was great app for my son's sports groups and a couple groups I'm in but I no longer get notifications from it.

Not getting notifications AND on top of that it doesn't show new dms even when I check the app manually. Just happened twice today. I've been checking my messages every 15 minutes or so and suddenly I receive a DM that was sent three hours ago and it never showed on the main screen!?	bug report
Only thing I don't like is that numbers I blocked can download this app and start a conversion with me.	feature request
The purpose of the app is great. Sometimes it freezes and after being added to a group sometimes it does not show up on the app just text. Also when you get in you still get text notifocation and through the app.	bug report

"My app continuously marks my messages as ""read"" before I even get the notification. Given that my team at work uses this app for important updates during the day, this is a major problem. I don't know how to fix it, but it has been doing this to me for years. It is very annoying."	bug report
It works when I'm using it, but without notifications, I can never keep up with what my group is talking about on time.	feature request
The app functions were improved, but they are still grossly behind of a comparable apps aka Discord or Telegram. The app allows to reply to a post, but search of a group member needs to improve. The app has a useful calendar function, but group moderators are not allowed to update or fix anything. Group moderator functions are extremely limited. The app often get broken and fails ro post a screenshots. The suggested rework is to uninstall and then reinstall. Upgraded from one star to 2 stars	feature request
The app has neen very useful. An avenue to share important information or to just reach out because the thought crossed your mind. I'm glad we have it.	irrelevant information
Everytime I try to log in itsays unexpected error. Won't let me create new account, uninstall reinstall restart... nothing works	bug report

Only problem is if you don't reply to messages, you get deleted from the group.	feature request
Need to fix notifications in general. Overall a good app to have. If you need to know exactly when someone texts you I would not recommend it	feature request
Awesome app with very fun emojis and meme creator function! Being able to like messages is another bonus against WhatsApp. Only complaint is that sometimes, sending photos and videos can take several tries. Other than that, great app.	irrelevant information
it works, nothing special	irrelevant information
I don't like if you change phone numbers and you go back to download the app again you cannot get back in because you cannot use that number because you don't have anymore and that's very confusing and I've been looking for some way to speak with someone about it I just want to clear off my old and I haven't been able to get any help with that other than that I like it	irrelevant information
No matter how many settings I tinker with, this app keeps me in the dark for hours after messages have been coming in. I never get notified for private messages, and in the last few months even group messages are not pushing to my phone. I've set the GroupMe settings to push AND my android phone settings are configured too. Photos sometimes only show for me as links which won't open. I have the latest Android software update so I don't know what gives. Very frustrating.	bug report

I hope this is fixed soon or we may need to switch to a different group messaging app.	bug report
It's a good app to stay in touch and easy to communicate to big groups BUT for every single message i get a notification at least 10 times even after I already opened the app and responded to the message. I tried to wait for a new update thinking it would stop but it has been happening for the last 3 updates so I'm getting quite annoyed. Please fix it and the star rating will go back up	bug report
I was issues with notifications, but now it works fine	irrelevant information
While the new updates are nice with calendar updates I still feel the lack of ability to delete previous private messages will have me moving away from this app. This could be a five star message app however to see conversations with people from year ago is a bit frustrating and congestive.

I can't seem to get past the unknown error message. Also what is the unknown error? The customer support is unresponsive after emailing multiple times. Bad bad experience all through.

It's great only if you don't tick off other person in the group. You can remove anyone who isn't the creator of the group.

Worked great with Google other than having to log in everyday to get messages. Then about a month later, it wouldn't log in at all even after three password resets, and I even changed from Google to Facebook logins. I got the email confirmation, but no logins.

Can't delete messages. Other than that, it's okay.	feature request
hate this app it's clunky dosnt like videos needs updates all the time but never fixes anyhmthing. try to scroll through pictures won't let you get past the first one.

After the last update you can no longer look and see who all likes your comments unless it was only a couple people. We used to use the like button to see who all wanted to participate in events, who all saw message, who agrees with decisions, etc. Now the like button is useless. We can't even use this app for what we intended to use it for anymore. Some users can see who likes messages and some can't. Sigh!	feature request
I love it!! It's great to text from apple to android, and create groups that can all FaceTime even if you have opposite phone (apple and android)! It's very simple, you can see when others are typing, read your messages, and you can like messages to! Overall a great app that 100% works. No ads, nothing you need to pay for.

Frequent bugs interrupt and severely hamper usability. When attempting to add contacts to a group, you must wait until GroupMe loads all the contacts in your phone. This is extremely inconvenient. Group chats fail to load from time to time. Direct message notifications sometimes do not show up, even when the settings allow for notifications. Large messages appear to send but don't. There is so much potential for this app, but it is unfortunately wasted by a lack of effort to clean up the bugs.	bug report
I literally NEVER recieve notifications when I need to and all of my group projects almost REQUIRE everyone to use this! It's terrible and the UI (User Interface) is just poor. I would rather use Snapchat or Facebook Messenger than ever use this app ever again!	bug report

My group messages have. disappeared. I tried to redownload the app, but theyre still not showing up. Sometimes notifications never even show up in the notification bar.	bug report
My buddies and I have good giggles with this one	irrelevant information
Some of the settings are hard to change or update from cell phone. However, I figured out they can be changed or updated on the PC. It would be nice to have the ability to change settings from the cell phone.	irrelevant information

Very easy to use and perfect chat for those who want group chats for ball teams for parents to converse back and forth. We love it	irrelevant information
I had a really hard time to access tge app, I had to use a different phone number. Won't accept my actual phone number nor email. It was a hassle. But other than that, great app, love that we can see the group messages even before you joined!	irrelevant information
If you have a group it's very useful to get in touch with everyone expecially if not everyone has the same phone type	irrelevant information
Very useful but has been extremely buggy for years. I also hate how I can't delete conversations, it's my conversation, I should have control over it.	feature request
it works for me.	irrelevant information
Notifications are generally buggy. Loading messages is buggy. The first private message someone sends me takes longer to receive each time. After three it was nine days. Yes it's up to date. I've had two installs on two different phones. Same problems. The support for this app is a joke. I don't know why this is popular.	bug report
It stopped working. This is an app I use for work, and now it doesn't work. It won't open. Going to try to uninstall and reinstall.	bug report
This is beyonf my favorite app. Used it for a year now BUT its acting up now. Wont let me mute nor do my mesages send out!	bug report
I use this for group chats	irrelevant information
All the groups just went missing. It deleted the groups but left the individual messages	irrelevant information
It's great but I don't like that you can't delete messages or posts! I want to be able to delete post on your phone. Sometimes it's too many moving emojis that use up your battery!	feature request
This app sucks at sending videos. I just tried to upload an 8-second video with no success. I tried several times. Please fix.	bug report
Quick and easy way to send and receive group messages.	irrelevant information
GroupMe works and looks good. I like having a separate place for my special, or even temporary group chats. I am one who is part of multiple organizations and clubs, and messaging through my phone's default apps presents challenges. GroupMe doesn't bridge all the gaps between Android and iPhone but I think it's better for specific club group chats.	feature request
Great functionality when it works, it doesn't work all the time. I wish this app was more reliable	irrelevant information
Efficient and easy to use. Makes communication with a large group simple.	irrelevant information
Seriously awful. I don't see some messages, and sometimes when I do they just won't load. Garbage	bug report
Great way to communicate with a group of friends.	irrelevant information
Join links for existing groups don't work on the app, which defeats the entire purpose. I signed up with my Google account on the app, but if I try to use the web version, I don't have the option of logging in with my Google account.	bug report

Had problems and your customer support is likely the worst i have ever seen. No way to get some help on the phone. It also had a problem where sms would be delayed hours, resulting in waking me up in the middle of the night. Have not seen that happen lately.	bug report
Evrytime you need the code by txt its bot going to cone through	bug report
I can't find anyone & they can't find me. Useless	bug report
This app has really been hit or miss lately. Have used it for years and Used to be a great app. Now my messages won't send for hours at a time. Or I won't get a notification, even tho an entire conversation took place hours prior. Or I DO receive a push notification, read my message and the notification is stuck at the top of my screen. Thinking about switching to another group messaging app. There is also no way to search messages which would be great since group threads tend to be lengthy.	bug report
Horrible with messages. Constantly has issues sending images and messages. Also, many times I don't receive messages until hours later even though all my apps work fine and I have perfect signal. I am definitely getting another grouping app.	bug report
I like the app... rather than hide conversations.. we should be able to delete them. Yup	feature request
Updating my review: went from 5 starts in 2017 to 2 in 2019. Freezing, not posting replies, not notifying me of new discussions. Major issues. I use this for work so time is important. If this continues, we're moving to WhatsApp	bug report
Good for work purposes...took off a star cuzz i already rated them...really annoying	irrelevant information
Not a huge fan of this app. It does most of what I expected but I and others in my chat group do not receive notifications consistently despite having the notification option turned on. Beyond that little hiccup, the app does what it says it does.	bug report
I've loved it before, but new phone and can't login through Facebook (embedded browser security) and no communication on how to remedy that. My family misses me.	feature request
It's a decent platform for communication, with smooth operation and quick replies.	irrelevant information
so i have been using the app for awhile but now my app does the same thing others are complaining about where it doesnt even send. and then finally hours later it tells me it was unable to send and i still cant send it even when i retry.	bug report
In the beginning I wasn't getting any notifications and I missed out on a lot of group chats dealing with my job. I had to go back and reset.	bug report
I find this app difficult to navagate. Not very user friendly.	feature request
Excellent way to have a conversation without traveling! Can write and attach documents which helps so much with collaboration. My only wish (and this might be something that I have not turned on) is that it would open to the first message that I have not read - like Signal.	feature request
The app worked fine for me until I had to replace phone and it took a while to re-establish a connection. Now lots of messages in messages and no way to transfer them over.	feature request

I have to use this app for work and it recently stopped playing notification sounds. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and checking all the settings which are correct and it still does not work. It is useless without knowing when I am receiving messages. Please fix.	bug report

Although Groupme has been very helpful for groups chats through high school/college, there is plenty if room for improvement. Most notably the lack of message threads. I'll often find myself scrolling through countless messages regarding the same topic. This causes the chats to become very cluttered. If it was possible to respond on a message thread this could be avoided	feature request
Its been a good communication tool but there is no option/button to delete photos in the gallery.	feature request

There user interface could look nicer to look at, everything so rectangular and there is no different color for who text. There is different profile image but when everything align the same way you sometimes don't know who texted what for a moment. This interface reminds me.of early 2000 texting when it was first coming out. This is just my opinion, you will have to try for yourself .	feature request

Last year I left a review saying how hard it is to send pictures. A year later it is still nearly impossible and nothing has been fixed or done. This is really shameful.	irrelevant information
Accessing the camera in app takes too many clicks. The desk top version lacks the features that enticed my friends to start using the app. If you will be a heavy on desktop user I'd recommend slack. GroupMe is a step up from Facebook messenger but just feels lacking.	feature request
My team in a game I play use GroupMe because it's more secure than other options easily open to everyone. We have one large regional group with many granular local and interest sub-groups. Private conversations are easy as is silencing notifications when needed.	irrelevant information
it some how got an unappreciated scam that tried to get my credit card information	irrelevant information
Hey Groupme, when is the Android version of this app going to get updated to look like the Apple version?? It looks a lot better on iPhones and more people would probably use it if it looked as good as the Apple variant.	feature request
Once I updated to 4.5 my attachments became unviewable by others in my groups...plus I cant see any attachments that others have posted since the update.	bug report
There's significant room for improvement. Would've given it two stars, but am aware of how much time and effort development takes. Missing a lot of features that WhatsApp, Slack and Microsoft Teams offer.	feature request

I had the app a few years ago when I had a different phone number. Tried to change the number online and was prompted to email support for assistance. 2 emails and 12 days later, not even an automated response acknowledging my request...which means I can only receive messages via text...defeats the purpose	bug report
"As mentioned in the 5/8/19 top critical review, this app has gotten buggy to the point of being completely unusable.

Good app for group chats with multiple options for notifications you can adjust as needed, so you don't have to be constantly bothered by a conversation you don't care about. Also allows you to directly message people on the group individually. Easy to set up, easy to use, never had any tech issues with it.	irrelevant information
Cannot send multiple pics at one time.  Videos rarely go through even ones under 30 sec.  If it fails it stays at the bottom of the chat lot and you have to scroll up just to see new messages.	bug report
Both my phones no longer load images...this common?	bug report
It works well and has proven to be very convenient for keeping informed about the goings-on at work.	irrelevant information
Great app for people with different phones! Android vs. Apple	irrelevant information
It works, but that's the only positive thing that can be said about this app. Notifications come through incorrectly, the app is incredibly slow, and the QR code scanning to join a GroupMe doesn't work, forcing me to load the link in my browser, force desktop mode, and log into GroupMe's web client. The app needs a complete overhaul to be remotely acceptable.	bug report
I can delete stuff or people. I don't like this app at all.	irrelevant information
The app is incredible buggy. Will not send me notifications about messages, group chats that I am in charge of and need for work show me people that were removed months ago but won't let me @ people that r still in there. Also frequently won't let me add new members to the group chats. Terrible app do not use, especially for work.	bug report
It really keeps me informed	irrelevant information
I like being able to keep in touch with people whose busy lives make it hard. Group me allows to always have a conversation or chat all together.	irrelevant information
I really like the general idea of this app. Its super cool......when the notifications work. I've tried EVERYTHING. I make sure theyre on for the chat, theyre on for the app, and theyre on for my phone and they STILL dont work. I think its a common problem because Ive heard other people complain about it.....and it really bothers me. And like on top of no notifications, when I look at the chat, it acts as if Ive already looked at it. So thats a real bummer :((	bug report

I'll start out by saying that I don't mind the new UI. It's fine. But my issue lies in 2 annoying bugs. Sometimes, moving from 1 channel to another will keep the current channel on display and refuse to load any new content. Checking DMs has a chance to get a message that states that the chat is in read-only mode for a second or 2, then proceed to let you go about normally. Please fix these issues! The channel issue especially is extremely annoying!	bug report

35 mbps down and up is too slow to make a call. something is erong with this app if that is too slow. can't call, can't text, what's the point if you can't do what you say you're going to do? piece of junk, not worth wasting time on it.	bug report

One ad will constantly run and take up the bottom half of my screen. I understand the need for ads but it can just be too much at times and it slows down the app and freezes.	bug report
very useful when covid-19 keeps you from work and your behind on your bills. Just download the app and your pretty much set on your way. at least through text.... besides I don't like talking on the phone. I'm not saying you can't call anyone. you just have to watch a short ad to obtain free minutes to make calls.	irrelevant information
Every time i call i have bad service. Or when i get incoming calls no one can hear me and they or i have to hang up and redial. Or its slow on the txtng... Especially if i have to erase a word and rewrite. Its alot to work with	bug report
There are chats I'm on that I can only receive text messages through and not the actual chat its annoying	bug report
Beware....its like getting a text every single time. Its def useful but can be a whole lot of dinging on your phone	irrelevant information
I would give it 5 stars but I can't. Because when I try to log in it sometimes takes forever until I reinstall it. And in mobile u should add hypesquad badges. There are also a lots if glitches like my text get send 2times or sometime it doesn't go.	bug report
It's been fine but it won't let me join a server that I want to join even tho my account is over a month and a half old	bug report
Notifications aren't working at all. My family uses it and I'm trying to move them off because it's useless to me. Also, uploading photos or videos with a slow connection constantly fails, it can't simply load in the background. Incredibly poor app, wish I didn't have to use it! Also does odd things like occasionally tell me i have hundreds of new messages, and there is no decent search function. I could go on and on.	bug report

Love u discord, met my gf on here. It works well but audio sometimes sucks for no reason Update we broke up lol but like now vc isnt working for no reason?	bug report
Initially, I rally hated this ui design, and I still do not like it but the change is whatever what I'd really annoying at the moment is the silly glitches and problems that have come with this change other than that it's not the best update and definitely one of the worst but I don't fully hate it now	bug report
This app used to be great. The new UI is needless and horrible, and I don't want to "get used to it." I want the option to revert to the old layout. Swiping to reply to messages? Dumb. Everything takes longer than it used to, and for some reason, they removed the ability to revert back to the old one. Literally, why, that's so stupid, let people pick. I really like themes. I like some of the new icons! But I wish companies would stop overhauling their UI, making it worse, then forcing users on.	feature request
Been using it for a couple months. I like it a lot. Simple interface, that does what I need without all the stuff I do not care about.	irrelevant information
Was great! Then it started hanging up during a call? Have great wifi so I don't know what the problem is?	bug report
This app is great with one exception, that is there's no option to cancel or remove anything that has been downloaded.	feature request
I was using this app and now that I tried to update it and now I can't get back in it said to continue with Google I push it and then it won't let me go any further what do I do how can I get it to work	bug report
New layout just complicated things. It made nothing easier. Doesn't look any better you just literally made it more difficult to navigating from servers to friends or even finding members in the server.. this was a complete downgrade taking a good format and now making you click more buttons to get around... worst part is each update you add more ways to monetize for money but not actually giving back anything to the community other than a fresh look that isn't user friendly	feature request
Glitchy Signs me out every 2 minutes	bug report
It works perfectly! Or almost perfect tehee! It'd be perfect if it had the option to share your audio with the rest of the people during a call. At least we can share our screen but with that feature it'd be perfect!	feature request
It stopped letting me call and get calls all of a sudden. No warning or anything. I have this number on my resume which I will be changing, and I cannot tell anyone about this app.	bug report
Had it for a year, worked fine until recently. Something has gone wrong with it. 8-31-18	bug report
As stated in a earlier review... Decent app when you have a strong data connection. Funny thing is, app has no problem loading the ads but struggles to load your messages.	bug report
It consumes a lot of battery when used	bug report
Good on other devices but when I am out of the house in a building WITH WiFi, it is stuck on the "connecting" screen. It only work on my phone in my house	bug report
Not work . Not send verification code .	bug report
The app is basically unusuable for me, I used to use it alot as a kid. It downloads spam apps and malware into your phone and makes it so difficult to use if you don't pay. Its not free, its a lie. Check out the most recent reviews, they are all 1 star.	bug report
I can't change my number on the account.	bug report
Lot of dropped calls  don't get the text on time	bug report
The app need to update who has read the messages that are sent to the entire group not just for direct messaging. Messenger allows you to see who read the message that was sent the the group.	feature request
Works well in its own , but has a nasty bad timing and failure issue that team up at the worst possible moments to kibosh any and all of your efforts at the moment.	bug report

I keep getting random people texting and calling me thinking im someone else!!!

Also a few times when I've texted a friend whose had the same number for a long time now I get someone else saying this isnt (friends name)!!!!!	irrelevant information
This is the most recent UI update awful and completely unnecessary. Everything has been moved around into more clunky and inconvenient locations. The previous UI worked perfectly fine. Why is something being "fixed" that ain't broken.	feature request

Not a fan of the new UI updates, everything feels difficult to use and I don't know where some things went.	feature request
New update is awful, UI is bloated with unnecessary things that just makes it slower and more effort to do the same tasks as before. Feels like every update just gets worse and reminds me of why everyone left skype, going to get a head start on looking for an alternative	bug report

Your app is dangerous in how it could get a person killed due to its delay in received messages. This little thing could cause a unforseen misfortune for someone. I suggest because you know or should know that it's a incorrect malfunction you fix it immediately	bug report

Great app to make or contact friends [or be a troll, dunno what you like] but I am having issues with VC lately, it always says connecting no matter what I do. I deleted app and re-downloaded, tried to see if it needed to be updated, nothing worked. But other than that, i hope you don't run into the same problem.	bug report
Works well. I wish it was end to end encrypted by default.	feature request

Best app for connect private with family and friends	irrelevant information
every update seems to bring something worse to the table. i can now only navigate discord through the desktop client or using an older UI. many new updates are pointless at best , the new mobile layout is unappealing and clunky, and there is no way to opt out of any of it. most (if not all) decent new features are paywalled behind a nitro subscription, the price of which has been steadily rising and rising. used to be good for communities but discord is now just a shell of its former self. :(	bug report
I can't open app in one of my groups	bug report
The recent UI change for the mobile app is terrible, unintuitive, and was accompanied with a slew of bugs and glitches that I've never had an issue with before the app changed. For example, sometimes it'll get stuck on a channel in one server and only show me that one even when I change to other channels or even other servers, and I have to fully exit & shut down the app in my settings to fix it. Also search function is so much worse & frustrating!!	bug report

The new mobile UI is, as a whole...not great There are some great features such as being able to narrow your search to links you posted but the fact that you can't narrow down searches by channel anymore is baffling Same with swiping right to see members or the search bar.

Skype has started to feel like a cheap app developd in some garage and keeps on getting worse. It has permision to access my contacts but shows all the ppl in the world except the people who are actually in my phone directory. Another thing is that it takes money from my PayPal before my old subscription expires.So at the moment my old subscription expires on 17.1.Bt it deducts for new package on 14.1. and the new package isn't activated so why charge me before due date.

I rarely write reviews but with this update I had to. Whoever designed this latest update and approved it must of been drinking far too early in the day. This new UI is so dam confusing to the point where I still haven't figured out how to see who's online in my server and doubt I'll even bother trying. I won't be using Discord on my phone again until things get changed back or I can figure out how to install a previous version.	bug report
Love it! Literally has not ever done me wrong in the 4 yrs I've been using this app. The ONLY issue I have is the uncontrollably apps playing inside the app. Other than that, this app is amazeballs.	bug report

This new app is really bad, why try and compete with the likes of the already established video calling apps, things that used to be quick and easy are now difficult to do in the new app. Update this app hasn't improved, the dial pad keeps disappearing and is nearly impossible to find again, by the time you bring it back the operator has finished saying all the options. Does anyone in the Skype division actually use Skype, it's designed like all things Asian, really badly	bug report
Sometimes doesn't connect, drops calls, I only like the option of buying phone number for a year, and you can buy Sim but none of my Samsung phones are compatible therefore I think they just want you to buy a phone from them. It works fine 80% of time n connections are spotty..	bug report
Mobile app has gotten significant buggier in the last few releases, to the point where you have to force close and reopen just to see new messages. Switching channels no longer works -- it always shows outdated content from the first channel you had open. Pictures load incorrectly or not at all. It seems the developers are far more concerned rushing out new features than quality control. It's unfortunate because discord used to be great, but it feels like they're a corporate cash grab now.	bug report
So, discord is an amazing app! Few problems. Whenever I go into a vc and I try to put it to speaker it won't work. Also gifs and photos, they take like an hour to send. Please fix these	bug report
Another great app bites the dust. Thanks Google.	irrelevant information
Pretty positive experience except the fact I used to be able to join discord calls on my ps5 but now it just tells me transfer voice failed and saying to make sure my ps5 is definitely on which it is. No one else on YouTube seems to have the problem so I have no way of solving it. I've uninstall discord, I've unlinked my account, reset my ps5 many times and nothing has worked. Please tell me how I can fix this and you'll get 5 stars	bug report

Trash app, I've been using this app for almost a year & that's way longer then I should have. You can't clear your inbox to clean it up, you have to manually open each message & delete, Very annoying. Phone calls are always having issues even when both parties are on great connections. Ads take up 80% of your screen, So a lot of time your accidently clicking on a BS ad you didn't want to click on by checking messages because they app is slow af on loading. Overall headache.

Garbage app makes you pay $10 a month to receive a verification code. DELETE!	bug report
This app was working great before the new UI update. Now it's slow and lags. It lags when I switch from private messages to switching to servers. Before the update the app was super snappy. It was prob the snappiest app on my phone. Now it's on the same level as the McDonald's app.	bug report

Something has happened to this app in the past year. Random issues with refreshing with newly received messages, inability to see channels, issues sliding over to the member/server lists.

Recent update was a massive UI/UX step backwards. They made dark mode even higher contrast, which actually makes it harder to read text. They removed the ability to partially drag over and quickly see channels for activity, now you have to switch over to an entirely full page with all kinds of channel info no one cares about. There needs to be an option to revert to the old layout, and Discord needs to find a new UI/UX design lead.	feature request

I had to reset my password so I could get into my account then immediately had to reset my password again because Microsoft can't check when someone last reset their password.

Rating this a two, wanna know why? This hour. I tried to log in to my discord account, I entered the right gmail pass everything it said ' Please, restart your password to log in.' It didnt send me any password request. So im stuck here tryna' figure out what to do. Pls discord fix this, I cant log in. Fix this bug or whatever it is. Like seriously I did everything right, why cant I just log in into my account? Please, i hope you notice my review and send tips on how to fix this.	bug report
Just installed the app 2 weeks ago. Useful app but despite using the app within the designated time my number was reassigned and I had to get a new number. So I have to go back and add the new number to any app an up my number and notify contacts that my number has changed. If it happens again I'll delete the app and use a different one. I suspect that reassigning your number even if you use it regularly is a tactic to get people to pay for the app.	bug report

every update is a downgrade. the search option is now bugged (constantly brings the keyboard up no matter where I press) and useless, as media is separated from messages and jumping to messages containing the media does not seem to be a thing	bug report

Good for group communications!!! Especially baseball teams	irrelevant information
The app is pretty good but drains my battery excessively fast - currently after 27 mins of use - it's used 47% of my battery since last charge. This issue pops up sporadically, lasts a few wks & then gets better. Today, I've had to literally charge my phone 3 times between 7am & 4pm. Normally the battery lasts from about 7am-9pm or so. Super annoying. I notice when I'm having this battery drain issue, calls via Signal don't come through either.	bug report
it's pretty good for me and my work people's	irrelevant information
Its really awesome. Quite fast.	irrelevant information
The app is ok but really don't understand why you need my birthday. If it was not for my sons baseball team using this app i would just delete it. Whats app never ask me for my birthday!	irrelevant information
The mobile has an annoying glitch always needing to reopen discord. It glitches photos, texts, audios, servers, all app!! If isn't fixed, will be much better just ignore the mobile and use the desktop	bug report
Not bad. But it needs a more friendly or humourus fan base	irrelevant information
Does what it's supposed to except for one big thing....I don't ever get notifications of new messages. I have to open the app, and only then do I get notified. Please fix!! I check every day to see if there is an update to fix this! So frustrating!	bug report

Fix to work from crashing on phones like sanding galaxy f victory	bug report
Works more or less as intended. On my old galaxy tab a, it lags a bunch and most of the time I get the "textnow isn't responding" popup. Also, it is completely ridiculous to make people pay to get verification codes, as that makes up most of the people using your service. I get that it's good for marketing, but you've gotta be losing people do to that. But I really can't complain about the call quality and reception. But for a free app, it's ok.	bug report
When you are in a call there is a lag between you and the other person. It's a minor flaw but makes for some tedious calls	bug report
Honestly what a shitshow. First the username change and now the mobile UI? Back when it was in testing at least you could choose to turn it off. Now it's stuck to this new unintuitive layout. Discord's response so far was "we know, we don't care, get used to it". It goes to show that they don't care about their long time users, catering to be "like other apps" instead of being something different (better) like they used to be. Instead of fun it feels very corporate and sterile now. Smh.	bug report
Don't believe description, its not free calling, they give you 60 minutes then charge 18.99 for 1000 minutes..... so unless only plan to text this app isn't free	irrelevant information
Discord has been my go to app for years now I use it to talk to 90% of my friends and I have so much fun but this new update where you moved the servers and DMS to a separate thing I really hate it I need it changed back ASAP all of my friends hate it plsss... Change it...:((( I'm like refusing to use DMS I really don't like this update.. also I really dislike having to tap on the channel name to look at the members in the channel i like just swiping to the side please change thst back too..	feature request

Wonderful news about your new job and have fun with that beautiful family...	irrelevant information
It used to be such a good app when it wasn't updated. I think this new update sucks because I was so used to the old. As someone who uses this app daily, I think it's a good app I've made many friends. I also note, that my discord glitches a lot thanks to this. My messages don't show up when I send them sometimes. When I type something out it'll send but the sentence is still there when I typed it out. I have swiped the wrong way so many times. And now, I just see discord as an inconvenience.	bug report

The app is good. The lies are bad.	irrelevant information
The attempt to make this Mobile version looks like PC was the worst decision you guys have ever made, good thing it was finally cancelled.

Well all in all not ever going to give a 5 star! I can't even place a call or text! even with a great wifi signal, Sometimes it works fine.	bug report
Adds after ever call...	irrelevant information
Deleting the app. Why? Because signal devs decided that we could no longer text anyone but rather only those that actually have the app. That does me no good. While I enjoyed signal it's pretty much useless to me now. so I have to remove it. If SMS ever come back look me up.	irrelevant information
Why it is not add free? Why there is an add in the application? I really hate the add in the app. So I request to make it add free. I expect this to get solve in the next update.	feature request

It works good honestly the only problem I'm getting is when it is ringing it stops then ends the call	bug report
I have long been a fan of Discord but the newest mobile UI change has made navigating the app far more difficult. The app has seen several errors where loading into channels in another server swaps you back to the first server, in DMs you are brought far back into the conversation upon load. (To name a few). The app loads slowly and has a lot of bugs that need to be ironed out. It was an unnecessary change, and I would greatly appreciate being able to change back to the old mobile UI.	bug report
It's really good that is all I have to say	irrelevant information
This new version is way better	irrelevant information
it's all good!	irrelevant information
To many scammers. You allow scammer	irrelevant information
The update is not as terrible as people are making it out to be. As another reviewer said, muscle memory is destroyed, and it is definitely laggier, but it's far from unusable. I've used apps with much worse UI in my life. This sucks and I don't agree with the decision to force the new UI on everyone, though. I think they missed the "point" of Discord and why people like it. More steps to get to everything and more bugs. Who wanted this again???	bug report

Very poor dont use this app and waste of time it shows multiple names and when login having issuess	bug report
No more SMS! I loved this app because I could have all of my messages in one app. I didn't have to remember which contact did and didn't have signal. I could just open signal and have all messages together.	irrelevant information
Good app and I use it all the time for messaging friends and joining community servers based on games or other stuff, however the mobile app has gotten horrible from what it used to be like. Extremely laggy GIFs, videos not playing, the entire UI breaking and becoming too big to fit the mobile screen, notifications randomly not appearing when turned on and messages not sending.	bug report

Good app to talk to your friends	irrelevant information
Being able to text for free is helpful to keep sorely needed finances for other vital expenses. However, that being said, I often am left wondering if my messages are actually working (being sent/received) I often lose important information or notices due to glitches that stop messaging from loading and notifying me as well as messages that 10 or 20 minutes later pop up as unsent... This is frustrating, and has larger consequences when time sensitive texts not getting out in time to address.	bug report
May not change or update contact details - it's annoying. May not choose between phone numbers - only one given to use. Struggling since June 2017.	bug report

Update ruined app. Used to be very easy to access and maneuver now it's clunky, ugly, and borderline impossible to use for prolonged time due to how incredibly slow it is. Revert this awful decision.	feature request
Lately I've been struggling with the vc function. Randomly the audio of my friend would get loud for me and they couldn't hear me. Only thing that has fixed it was restarting discord. Also, the voice notes i send are very quiet eventhough my phone otherwise has no issues recording audio on other apps. Now the app closes when i try to send a video.	bug report
Calls dropping. I can hear the person whom I'm talking to but they can't hear me. Please fix asap	bug report
Insanely incompetent developers/project directors. Suffers from the same cancer that infests other software platforms and websites where they have too much money and the company starts fixating on a sort of "development creep" where they keep meticulously re-developing their product over and over again, reducing the usability of it each time. Discord had a decent app back in 2018. They continuously made it worse. Also, stop trying to aim your platform at people that aren't your target audience.	irrelevant information
just a great app, i really recommend, just watch out for those stupid creeps👍	irrelevant information
It used to be the only app I could use, and now it has failed me. I can't log into my account, and I can't make a new one. I'm on Facebook messenger right now, so it has nothing to do with my network like it keeps telling me. I think it is time for a new update of this application. I'm tired of not being able to log in.	bug report
This is not a good app because it actively blocks important calls and text you recieve. If you use the phone number to verify something like an indeed login or a swagbucks login it blocks the verification text and tries to charge you $4.99	bug report

So slow. I have to wait 5 minutes for the call to load. And then it's so hard to check whether my camera is on. I can't even maneuver during a call. The default speaker view during a group call is always never the person speaking.

The updated UI does nothing but bloat the application and make everything run about 3x slower than before. When loading videos in the app there's a 50% chance it will just crash entirely and the new "streamlined" server organization and lookup features are insanely clunky. It doesn't match the PC version of Discord either which makes switching back and forth even more confusing, especially for new users. Very icky I dont like it 😠 2 stars literally only because it still sends messages SOMETIMES	bug report
This app is a life-saver!!!!	irrelevant information
New Layout is so unnecessary and only more bugs to be put into. It used to be so great up until now. Discord really let it's go.	irrelevant information
Everything is great but in the latest version I'm not able to backup my old chats as every time I enter my number it switches it back to +1 by default and says Too many attempts. Please fix at your earliest. Thanks	bug report
To put simply, this update is full of bugs and issues. Images and videos are being sent to the wrong people. WHEN I'M ON A SERVER, they can end up in my DMs. I can not stress how blatantly unpolished an update WITH UI, this unacceptably messy is. Part of the charm of Discord is how distinct it is when compared to every other sterile, bland, and soulless website. I can not understand who felt that making discord sterile and inhospitable was a good idea.	bug report
The new update is terrible there are so many recurring bugs why not go back to how it was, keep it the same as the desktop version it worked perfectly fine then	feature request
Please make it simple. reduce colors and animations. keep it professional. And please remember your strengths, comparing to other apps, are calls ( conf. Call). Not social network!	feature request

Security seems to be an issue with this app. A couple of issues made me rate this app 3.5. 1. The app doesn't fully exit you after logging out of the account, after clicking the icon to get back into the account, it navigates you in, without asking for a username and password. 2. Literally, every time I want to use Skype, it tells me that my account was compromised and that I need to change my password.	bug report
Won't let me sign in.. obviously been high jacked!!	bug report

They made it much more difficult to navigate, old version was better.	feature request
Discord was a great app at one point, but the new mobile UI feels much worse. Both from a usability standpoint and also due to the fact that the new dark theme is so high contrast it's not very comfortable to look at. In my opinion the only worth while feature in the update was the swipe to reply, but it's a left side swipe and I'm right handed so I find I rarely use it. Everything else that used to feel familiar or good now seems like it takes more presses.	bug report
For some reason when I use call and play at the same time my phone keeps flashing black and that's why I got discord but now it's doing it again	bug report
Can you use normal sized banner ads instead of one's that take up a quarter of my screen, please? I know you can hide it with your keyboard, but still. edit: nevermind, it's even worse.	feature request

I've been subscribed paying a monthly membership and continuing to leave the requested review about problems after every call but the echo everyone hears is awful. And the conversations lag they complain they can't talk without hearing themselves and I've lost business because of it. Sad .. For how much money I've invested, I'm quite irritated.	bug report
Overall, this is a great app for a one stop shop communicator. There is one thing I'm not a fan of and that is the fact I am unable to delete or edit my message after it has been sent.	feature request

Never tried it.	irrelevant information
It's an OK service, but they should focus more on useful things than overly priced skins. There's a lot of bugs.	irrelevant information
few other ppl I know who use this.	irrelevant information
A very good app to get an US number without SIM. Also good to make calls over WiFi with an US number.	irrelevant information
should have stopped asking me to rate the stupid app.	irrelevant information
Bugs everywhere. The remix feature still doesn't work properly (especially the text editor), images and videos aren't always displayed correctly and sometimes the app just freezes entirely and won't load new messages despite having a good internet connection. The search function still doesn't work, and new messages aren't always showing up in general, and to top it all off, the new UI is just bad in every way.	bug report
You guys keep banning my account for term of use violation when I've done nothing wrong to get that. And none if my appeals have been heard from. This app is a waste of time.	irrelevant information
Sometimes my phone doesn't "push" to get message instantly. I have to hit the app in order to see a message.	bug report
Going back to the lite version... after update, I can't search contacts... it's crashing. Uninstalling...	bug report
Good 😊 very entertaining and source of connection with the people's	irrelevant information
I love this app occasional drop calls or freeze but other than that this app is awesome thank you for the service	bug report
